<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction to data</h1>
<p>Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations – collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments – form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called . Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in the context of a general process of investigation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify a question or problem.</li>
<li>Collect relevant data on the topic.</li>
<li>Analyze the data.</li>
<li>Form a conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Statistics as a subject focuses on making stages 2-4 objective, rigorous, and efficient. That is, statistics has three primary components: How best can we collect data? How should it be analyzed? And what can we infer from the analysis?</p>
<p>The topics scientists investigate are as diverse as the questions they ask. However, many of these investigations can be addressed with a small number of data collection techniques, analytic tools, and fundamental concepts in statistical inference. This chapter provides a glimpse into these and other themes we will encounter throughout the rest of the book. We introduce the basic principles of each branch and learn some tools along the way. We will encounter applications from other fields, some of which are not typically associated with science but nonetheless can benefit from statistical study.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Case study: using stents to prevent strokes</h2>
<p>Section <a href="introductionToData.html#basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes">1.1</a> introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.</p>
<p>In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Stents are small mesh tubes that are placed inside narrow or weak arteries to assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers who asked this question collected data on 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Treatment group.</strong> Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Group.</strong> Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group but did not receive stents.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.</p>
<p>Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in Table <a href="introductionToData.html#tab:stentStudyResultsDF">1.1</a>. Patient outcomes are recorded as “stroke” or “no event”.</p>

<p>Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards answering the original research question. Instead, a statistical analysis allows us to consider all of the data at once. Table <a href="#tab:stentStudyResults">1.2</a> summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.</p>
<p><span>l cc c cc</span> &amp; &amp;</p>
<p> &amp;<br />
&amp; stroke &amp; no event &amp;&amp; stroke &amp; no event<br />

control &amp; 13 &amp; 214 &amp;&amp; 28 &amp; 199<br />
Total &amp; 46 &amp; 405 &amp;&amp; 73 &amp; 378<br />
Table: (#tab:stentStudyResults) Descriptive statistics for the stent study.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Guided Practice 1.1</p>
<p>Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year. (Answers to all in-text exercises are provided in footnotes.)<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>We can compute summary statistics from the table. A <strong>summary statistics</strong> is a single number summarizing a large amount of data.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: <span class="math inline">\(45/224 = 0.20 = 20\%\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: <span class="math inline">\(28/227 = 0.12 = 12\%\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would <em>reduce</em> the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a “real” difference due to the treatment?</p>
<p>This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won’t observe exactly 50 heads. This type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?</p>
<p>While we haven’t yet covered statistical tools to fully address this question, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful:</strong> do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.</p>

<p>Table <a href="introductionToData.html#tab:email50DF">1.3</a> displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set concerning 50 emails received in 2012. These observations will be referred to as the data set, and they are a random sample from a larger data set that we will see in Section <a href="introductionToData.html#categoricalData">1.7</a>.</p>
<p>Each row in the table represents a single email or <strong>case</strong>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The columns represent characteristics, called <strong>variables</strong>, for each of the emails. For example, the first row represents email 1, which is not spam, contains 21,705 characters, 551 line breaks, is written in HTML format, and contains only small numbers.</p>
<p>In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and the units of measurement.

<p>The data in Table <a href="introductionToData.html#tab:email50DF">1.3</a> represent a <strong>data matrix</strong>, which is a common way to organize data. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case, and each column corresponds to a variable. A data matrix for the stroke study introduced in Section <a href="introductionToData.html#basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes">1.1</a> is shown in Table @ref(#tab:stentStudyResultsDF), where the cases were patients and there were three variables recorded for each patient.</p>

Figure 1.1: Breakdown of variables into their respective types
</p>
</div>
<p>Examine the <strong>fed_spend</strong>, <strong>pop2010</strong>, <strong>state</strong> , and <strong>smoking ban</strong> variables in the data set. Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three yet many of them share certain characteristics.</p>
<p>First consider <strong>fed_spend</strong>, which is said to be a <strong>numerical</strong> variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since their average, sum, and difference have no clear meaning.</p>
<p>The <strong>pop2010</strong> variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than <strong>fed_spend</strong>. This variable of the population count can only be a whole non-negative number (0, 1, 2, …). For this reason, the population variable is said to be <strong>dicrete</strong> since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the federal spending variable is said to be <strong>continuous</strong>.</p>
<p>The variable can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: AL, …, and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, <em>state</em> is called a <strong>categorical</strong> variable,<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and the possible values are called the variable’s <strong>levels</strong>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Consider the variables and (at 30 days) from the stent study in Section <a href="introductionToData.html#basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes">1.1</a>. Are these numerical or categorical variables?<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, consider the <strong>smoking ban</strong> variable, which describes the type of county-wide smoking ban and takes a value <strong>none</strong>, <strong>partial</strong>, or <strong>comprehensive</strong> in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an <strong>ordinal</strong> variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variables in this book will be treated as categorical variables.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1.3</strong>: Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories – those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course – which makes this variable categorical.</code></p>

<div id="variableRelations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Relationships between variables</h3>
<p>Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Is federal spending, on average, higher or lower in counties with high rates of poverty?</p></li>
<li><p>If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county likely be above or below the national average?</p></li>
<li><p>Which counties have a higher average income: those that enact one or more smoking bans or those that do not?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the data set shown in Table <a href="introductionToData.html#tab:countyDF">1.5</a>. Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually summarize data and are useful for answering such questions as well.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Scatterplots</strong> are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:countyfedspendVsPoverty">1.2</a> compares the variables <strong>fed_spend</strong> and <strong>poverty</strong>. Each point on the plot represents a single county. For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 1088 in the <strong>county</strong> data set: Owsley County, Kentucky, which had a poverty rate of 41.5% and federal spending of $21.50 per capita. The dense cloud in the scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a high poverty rate also tend to have slightly more federal spending. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which is the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Guided Practice 1.5</p>

<p>Because there is a downward trend in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:multiunitsVsOwnership">1.3</a> counties with more units in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership – these variables are said to be <strong>negatively associated</strong>.

<div id="overviewOfDataCollectionPrinciples" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Overview of data collection principles</h2>
<p>The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider <em>how</em> data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals.</p>
<div id="populationsAndSamples" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Populations and samples</h3>
<p>Consider the following three research questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?</p></li>
<li><p>Over the last 5 years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergraduate students?</p></li>
<li><p>Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each research question refers to a target <strong>population</strong>. In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic ocean, and each fish represents a case. It is usually too expensive to collect data for every case in a population. Instead, a sample is taken. A <strong>sample</strong> represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Guided Practice 1.7</p>
<p>For the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="anecdotalEvidenceSubsection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Anecdotal evidence</h3>
<p>Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.</p></li>
<li><p>I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.</p></li>
<li><p>My friend’s dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called <strong>anecdotal evidence</strong>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p><strong>Anecdotal Evidence</strong> Be careful of data collected haphazardly. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases.</p>
</div>
<p>Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that represent the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling-from-a-population" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Sampling from a population</h3>
<p>We might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last 5 years by collecting a sample of students. All graduates in the last 5 years represent the <em>population</em>, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the <em>sample</em>. In general, we always seek to <em>randomly</em> select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate’s name on a raffle ticket and draw 100 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 100 graduates.</p>
<p>Why pick a sample randomly? Why not just pick a sample by hand? Consider the following scenario.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1.8</strong> Suppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. What kind of students do you think she might collect? Do you think her sample would be representative of all graduates?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Perhaps she would pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields. Or perhaps her selection would be well-representative of the population. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a *biased* sample, even if that bias is unintentional or difficult to discern.</code></p>
<hr />
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:popToSampleGraduates"></span>
<img src="figures01/popToSample/popToSampleGraduates.pdf" alt="In this graphic, five graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample."  />
<p class="caption">

<div class="figure"><span id="fig:popToSubSampleGraduates"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.5: Instead of sampling from all graduates equally, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick graduates with health-related majors disproportionately often.
</p>
</div>
<p>If someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample could be skewed to that person’s interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces <strong>bias</strong> into a sample. Sampling randomly helps resolve this problem. The most basic random sample is called a <strong>simple random sample</strong>, which is equivalent to using a raffle to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and there is no implied connection between the cases in the sample.</p>
<p>The act of taking a simple random sample helps minimize bias, however, bias can crop up in other ways. Even when people are picked at random, e.g. for surveys, caution must be exercised if the <strong>non-response</strong> is high. For instance, if only 30% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, and it is unclear whether the respondents are <strong>representative</strong> of the entire population, the survey might suffer from <strong>non-response bias</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:surveySample"></span>
<img src="figures01/popToSample/surveySample.pdf" alt="Due to the possibility of non-response, surveys studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often impossible, to completely fix this problem."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.6: Due to the possibility of non-response, surveys studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often impossible, to completely fix this problem.
</p>
</div>
<p>Another common downfall is a <strong>convenience sample</strong> , where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, it will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is federal spending, on average, higher or lower in counties with high rates of poverty?</li>
</ol>
<p>If we suspect poverty might affect spending in a county, then poverty is the variable and federal spending is the <strong>response</strong> variable in the relationship.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> If there are many variables, it may be possible to consider a number of them as explanatory variables.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Explanatory and response variables</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To identify the explanatory variable in a pair of variables, identify which of the two is suspected of affecting the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Caution: association does not imply causation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Labeling variables as <em>explanatory</em> and <em>response</em> does not guarantee the relationship between the two is actually causal, even if there is an association identified between the two variables. We use these labels only to keep track of which variable we suspect affects the other.</p>
<hr />
<p>In some cases, there is no explanatory or response variable. Consider the following question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county likely be above or below the national average?</li>
</ol>
<p>It is difficult to decide which of these variables should be considered the explanatory and response variable, i.e. the direction is ambiguous, so no explanatory or response labels are suggested here.</p>
</div>
<div id="introducing-observational-studies-and-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Introducing observational studies and experiments</h3>
<p>There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments.</p>
<p>Researchers perform an <strong>observational study</strong> when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a <strong>cohort</strong> of many similar individuals to study why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe what happens. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection.</p>
<p>When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an <strong>experiment</strong>. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are <em>assigned</em> a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a <strong>randomized experiment</strong>. For example, each heart attack patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a <strong>placebo</strong> (fake treatment) and the second group receives the drug. See the case study in Section <a href="introductionToData.html#basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes">1.1</a> for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip: Association does not equal Causation</strong>: In a data analysis, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Observational studies</h3>
<p>Generally, data in observational studies are collected only by monitoring what occurs, while experiments require the primary explanatory variable in a study be assigned for each subject by the researchers.</p>
<p>Making causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Guided Practice 1.10</p>
<p>Suppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen <em>causes</em> skin cancer?<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, she is more likely to use sunscreen <em>and</em> more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple investigation.</p>

<p>Sun exposure is what is called a <strong>confounding variable</strong> ,<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which is a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables. While one method to justify making causal conclusions from observational studies is to exhaust the search for confounding variables, there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured.</p>

<p>Observational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A <strong>prospective study</strong> identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of similar individuals over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses’ Health Study, started in 1976 and expanded in 1989.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. <strong>Retrospective studies</strong> collect data after events have taken place, e.g. researchers may review past events in medical records. Some data sets, such as , may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables. Local governments prospectively collect some variables as events unfolded (e.g. retails sales) while the federal government retrospectively collected others during the 2010 census (e.g. county population).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Three sampling methods (special topic)</h3>
<p>Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, results from these statistical methods are not reliable. Here we consider three random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, and cluster sampling. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:samplingMethodsFigure">1.9</a> provides a graphical representation of these techniques.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:samplingMethodsFigure"></span>
<img src="figures01/samplingMethodsFigure/samplingMethodsFigure.pdf" alt="Examples of simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases. In the middle panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, and then simple random sampling was employed within each stratum. In the bottom panel, cluster sampling was used, where data were binned into nine clusters, and three of the clusters were randomly selected."  />

In the middle panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, and then simple random sampling was employed within each stratum. In the bottom panel, cluster sampling was used, where data were binned into nine clusters, and three of the clusters were randomly selected.
</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Simple random sampling</strong> is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league’s 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries from the 2010 season, we could write the names of that season’s 828 players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as “simple random” if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample <em>and</em> knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.</p>
<p><strong>Stratified sampling</strong> is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called <strong>strata</strong>. The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, the teams could represent the strata; some teams have a lot more money (we’re looking at you, Yankees). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for a total of 120 players.</p>
<p>Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1.12</strong> Why would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>We might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar. These improved estimates for each subpopulation will help us build a reliable estimate for the full population.</code></p>
<hr />
<p>In <strong>cluster sampling</strong>, we group observations into clusters, then randomly sample some of the clusters. Sometimes cluster sampling can be a more economical technique than the alternatives. Also, unlike stratified sampling, cluster sampling is most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don’t look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then this sampling method works best when the neighborhoods are very diverse. A downside of cluster sampling is that more advanced analysis techniques are typically required, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1.13</strong> Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next. What sampling method should be employed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling seems like a very good idea. We might randomly select a small number of villages. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample and would still give us helpful information.</code></p>
<hr />
<p>Another technique called <strong>multistage sampling</strong> is similar to cluster sampling, except that we take a simple random sample within each selected cluster. For instance, if we sampled neighborhoods using cluster sampling, we would next sample a subset of homes within each selected neighborhood if we were using multistage sampling.</p>

<div id="experimentsSection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Experiments</h2>
<p>Studies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called. When this assignment includes randomization, e.g. using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a . Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables.</p>
<div id="experimentalDesignPrinciples" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Principles of experimental design</h3>
<p>Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Controlling.</strong> Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to any other differences in the groups. For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may ask all patients to drink a 12 ounce glass of water with the pill.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Randomization.</strong> Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replication.</strong> The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Additionally, a group of scientists may replicate an entire study to verify an earlier finding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blocking.</strong> Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as . For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients into low-risk and high-risk , then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:figureShowingBlocking">1.10</a>. This strategy ensures each treatment group has an equal number of low-risk and high-risk patients.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:figureShowingBlocking"></span>
<img src="figures01/figureShowingBlocking/figureShowingBlocking.pdf" alt="Blocking using a variable depicting patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then each block is evenly divided into the treatment groups using randomization.

</p>

<p>It is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.</p>

<div id="biasInHumanExperiments" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Reducing bias in human experiments</h3>
<p>Randomized experiments are the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause and effect relationships in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.</p>
<p>These researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug’s effect. Study volunteers<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the <strong>treatment group</strong> , received the drug. The other group, called the <strong>control group</strong>, did not receive any drug treatment.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group doesn’t receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation doesn’t increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect that is difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>Researchers aren’t usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be <strong>blind</strong>. But there is one problem: if a patient doesn’t receive a treatment, she will know she is in the control group. The solution to this problem is to give fake treatments to patients in the control group. A fake treatment is called a <strong>placebo</strong>, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. Often times, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the <strong>placebo effect</strong>.</p>
<p>The patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can accidentally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, she might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that she knows is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The <strong>mean</strong>, sometimes called the average, is a common way to measure the center of a <strong>distribution</strong> of data. To find the mean number of characters in the 50 emails (see Equation <a href="introductionToData.html#eq:mean">(1.1)</a>), we add up all the character counts and divide by the number of emails.

<p>The <strong>email50</strong> data set is a sample from a larger population of emails that were received in January and March. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean. However, there is a difference in notation: the population mean has a special label: <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em> and represents the average of all observations in the population.

<p>The <strong>county</strong> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people.

If we completed these steps with the data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $27,348.43.

<p>Histograms provide a view of the <strong>data density</strong>. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more dense. For instance, there are many more emails between 0 and 10,000 characters than emails between 10,000 and 20,000 characters in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the number of characters.</p>
<p>Histograms are especially convenient for describing the shape of the data distribution. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:email50NumCharHist">1.15</a> shows that most emails have a relatively small number of characters, while fewer emails have a very large number of characters. When data trail off to the right in this way and have a longer right , the shape is said to be <strong>right skewed</strong>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.4</span> Variance and standard deviation</h3>
<p>The mean is used to describe the center of a data set, but the in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though the formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to conceptually understand, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.</p>
<p>We call the distance of an observation from its mean its <em>deviation</em>. Below are the deviations for the <span class="math inline">\(1^{st}_{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^{nd}_{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3^{rd}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}_{}\)</span> observations in the variable. For computational convenience, the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first decimal.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
x_1^{}-\bar{x} &amp;= 21.7 - 11.6 = 10.1 \hspace{5mm}\text{ } \\
x_2^{}-\bar{x} &amp;= 7.0 - 11.6 = -4.6 \\
x_3^{}-\bar{x} &amp;= 0.6 - 11.6 = -11.0 \\
            &amp;\ \vdots \\
x_{50}^{}-\bar{x} &amp;= 15.8 - 11.6 = 4.2\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is about equal to the sample <em>variance</em>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s_{}^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
s_{}^2 &amp;= \frac{10.1_{}^2 + (-4.6)_{}^2 + (-11.0)_{}^2 + \cdots + 4.2_{}^2}{50-1} \\
    &amp;= \frac{102.01 + 21.16 + 121.00 + \cdots + 17.64}{49} \\
    &amp;= 172.44\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We divide by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>, rather than dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, when computing the variance; you need not worry about this mathematical nuance for the material in this textbook. Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values much larger, seen by comparing <span class="math inline">\(10.1^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-4.6)^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-11.0)^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(4.2^2\)</span>. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.</p>
<p>The <em>standard deviation</em> is the square root of the variance: <span class="math display">\[s=\sqrt{172.44} = 13.13\]</span> [</p>
<p>The standard deviation of the number of characters in an email is about 13.13 thousand. A subscript of <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s_x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_x^{}\)</span>, as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_1^{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2^{}\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(x_n^{}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(_{x}\)</span> subscript is usually omitted when it is clear which data the variance or standard deviation is referencing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Variance and Standard Deviation</strong> The variance is roughly the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and describes how close the data are to the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formulas and methods used to compute the variance and standard deviation for a population are similar to those used for a sample.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> However, like the mean, the population values have special symbols: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{}^2\)</span> for the variance and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for thge standard deviation.

<p>In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the “end” is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.5</span> Box plots, quartiles, and the median</h3>
<p>A <em>box plot</em> summarizes a data set using five statistics while also plotting unusual observations. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:boxPlotLayoutNumVar">1.19</a> provides a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the variable from the data set.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line denoting the <em>median</em>, which splits the data in half. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:boxPlotLayoutNumVar">1.19</a> shows 50% of the data falling below the median (dashes) and other 50% falling above the median (open circles). There are 50 character counts in the data set (an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two groups of 25. We take the median in this case to be the average of the two observations closest to the <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> percentile: <span class="math inline">\((\text{6,768} + \text{7,012}) / 2 = \text{6,890}\)</span>. When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in this case that observation is the median (no average needed).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Median: the number in the middle</strong> If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the <em>median</em> is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data. The total length of the box, shown vertically in Figure @ref(fig:boxPlotLayoutNumVar, is called the <em>interquartile range</em> (, for short). It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR. The two boundaries of the box are called the <em>first quartile</em> (the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> , i.e. 25% of the data fall below this value) and the <em>third quartile</em> (the <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentile), and these are often labeled <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, respectively.</p>

In Figure [boxPlotLayoutNumVar], the upper whisker does not extend to the last three points, which are beyond <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span>, and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 33, since there is no additional data to reach; the lower whisker’s limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\)</span>. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.</p>
<p>Any observation that lies beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points – instead of just extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values – is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually distant observations are called . In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 41,623, 42,793, and 64,401 as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.</p>

<p>There are some standard transformations that are often applied when much of the data cluster near zero (relative to the larger values in the data set) and all observations are positive. A <em>transformation</em> is a rescaling of the data using a function. For instance, a plot of the natural logarithm<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> of player salaries results in a new histogram in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:histMLBSalariesLog">1.22</a>. Transformed data are sometimes easier to work with when applying statistical models because the transformed data are much less skewed and outliers are usually less extreme.</p>
<p>Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the and variables is shown in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:email50LinesCharactersMod">1.23</a>, which was earlier shown in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:email50LinesCharacters">1.11</a>. We can see a positive association between the variables and that many observations are clustered near zero. In Chapter 5], we might want to use a straight line to model the data. However, we’ll find that the data in their current state cannot be modeled very well. Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:email50LinesCharactersModLog">1.24</a> shows a scatterplot where both the and variables have been transformed using a log (base <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>) transformation. While there is a positive association in each plot, the transformed data show a steadier trend, which is easier to model than the untransformed data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The federal spending intensity map shows substantial spending in the Dakotas and along the central-to-western part of the Canadian border, which may be related to the oil boom in this region. There are several other patches of federal spending, such as a vertical strip in eastern Utah and Arizona and the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas meet. There are also seemingly random counties with very high federal spending relative to their neighbors. If we did not cap the federal spending range at $18 per capita, we would actually find that some counties have extremely high federal spending while there is almost no federal spending in the neighboring counties. These high-spending counties might contain military bases, companies with large government contracts, or other government facilities with many employees. Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does the southwest border of Texas. The vertical strip of eastern Utah and Arizona, noted above for its higher federal spending, also appears to have higher rates of poverty (though generally little correspondence is seen between the two variables). High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>

For example, the value 149 corresponds to the number of emails in the data set that are spam <em>and</em> had no number listed in the email. Row and column totals are also included. The <em>row totals</em> provide the total counts across each row (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(149 + 168 + 50 = 367\)</span>), and <em>column totals</em> are total counts down each column.</p>
<p>A table for a single variable is called a <em>frequency table</em>. Table <a href="#tab:emailNumberTable"><strong>??</strong></a> is a frequency table for the variable. If we replaced the counts with percentages or proportions, the table would be called a <em>relative frequency table</em>.</p>

<p>A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way, where each is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total. Table <a href="#tab:colPropSpamNumber"><strong>??</strong></a> shows such a table, and here the value 0.271 indicates that 27.1% of emails with no numbers were spam. This rate of spam is much higher than emails with only small numbers (5.9%) or big numbers (9.2%). Because these spam rates vary between the three levels of <strong>number</strong> (none, small ,big ), this provides evidence that the and variables are associated.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1.41</strong> Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages. By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. One of those characteristics is whether the email contains no numbers, small numbers, or big numbers. Another characteristic is whether or not an email has any HTML content. A contingency table for the and variables from the data set are shown in Table <a href="#tab:emailSpamHTMLTableTotals"><strong>??</strong></a>. Recall that an HTML email is an email with the capacity for special formatting, e.g. bold text. In Table <a href="#tab:emailSpamHTMLTableTotals"><strong>??</strong></a>, which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email: row or column proportions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a person would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format. This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails. If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (<span class="math inline">\(209/1195 = 17.5\%\)</span>) than compared to HTML emails (<span class="math inline">\(158/2726 = 5.8\%\)</span>). This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam. Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, such as and other variables, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some email as spam or not spam.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Segmented bar and mosaic plots</h3>
<p>Contingency tables using row or column proportions are especially useful for examining how two categorical variables are related. Segmented bar and mosaic plots provide a way to visualize the information in these tables.</p>
<p>A <strong>segmented bar plot</strong> is a graphical display of contingency table information. For example, a segmented bar plot representing Table <a href="#tab:colPropSpamNumber"><strong>??</strong></a> is shown in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:emailSpamNumberSegBar">1.30</a>, where we have first created a bar plot using the <strong>number</strong> variable and then separated each group by the levels of <strong>spam</strong>. The column proportions of Table <a href="#tab:colPropSpamNumber"><strong>??</strong></a> have been translated into a standardized segmented bar plot in Figure <a href="introductionToData.html#fig:emailSpamNumberSegBarSta">1.31</a>, which is a helpful visualization of the fraction of spam emails in each level of <strong>number</strong>.</p>

This second plot makes it clear that emails with no number have a relatively high rate of spam email – about 27%! On the other hand, less than 10% of email with small or big numbers are spam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the proportion of spam changes across the groups in Figure [emailSpamNumberSegBarSta], we can conclude the variables are dependent, which is something we were also able to discern using table proportions. Because both the and groups have relatively few observations compared to the group, the association is more difficult to see in Figure [emailSpamNumberSegBar].</p>
<p>In some other cases, a segmented bar plot that is not standardized will be more useful in communicating important information. Before settling on a particular segmented bar plot, create standardized and non-standardized forms and decide which is more effective at communicating features of the data.</p>
<p>[emailSpamNumberMosaicPlot]</p>
<p>A <em>mosaic plot</em> is a graphical display of contingency table information that is similar to a bar plot for one variable or a segmented bar plot when using two variables. Figure [emailNumberMosaic] shows a mosaic plot for the variable. Each column represents a level of , and the column widths correspond to the proportion of emails of each number type. For instance, there are fewer emails with no numbers than emails with only small numbers, so the no number email column is slimmer. In general, mosaic plots use box <em>areas</em> to represent the number of observations.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:emailSpamNumberMosaicRev"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.32: Mosaic plot where emails are grouped by the variable after they’ve been divided into and .
</p>
</div>
<p>This one-variable mosaic plot is further divided into pieces in Figure [emailSpamNumberMosaic] using the variable. Each column is split proportionally according to the fraction of emails that were spam in each number category. For example, the second column, representing emails with only small numbers, was divided into emails that were spam (lower) and not spam (upper). As another example, the bottom of the third column represents spam emails that had big numbers, and the upper part of the third column represents regular emails that had big numbers. We can again use this plot to see that the and variables are associated since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized version of the segmented bar plot.</p>
<p>In a similar way, a mosaic plot representing row proportions of Table [emailSpamNumberTableTotals] could be constructed, as shown in Figure [emailSpamNumberMosaicRev]. However, because it is more insightful for this application to consider the fraction of spam in each category of the variable, we prefer Figure [emailSpamNumberMosaic].</p>

<p>While pie charts are well known, they are not typically as useful as other charts in a data analysis. A <em>pie chart</em> is shown in Figure  alongside a bar plot. It is generally more difficult to compare group sizes in a pie chart than in a bar plot, especially when categories have nearly identical counts or proportions. In the case of the and categories, the difference is so slight you may be unable to distinguish any difference in group sizes for either plot!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.5</span> Comparing numerical data across groups</h3>
<p>Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups. The methods required here aren’t really new. All that is required is to make a numerical plot for each group. Here two convenient methods are introduced: side-by-side box plots and hollow histograms.</p>
<p>We will take a look again at the data set and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2000 to 2010 versus counties that had no gain. While we might like to make a causal connection here, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be unjustified.</p>
<p>There were 2,041 counties where the population increased from 2000 to 2010, and there were 1,099 counties with no gain (all but one were a loss). A random sample of 100 counties from the first group and 50 from the second group are shown in Table [countyIncomeSplitByPopGainTable] to give a better sense of some of the raw data.</p>

However, they do not interact with the study’s patients and do not tell the blinded health care professionals who is receiving which treatment.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref19">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>The researchers assigned the patients into their treatment groups, so this study was an experiment. However, the patients could distinguish what treatment they received, so this study was not blind. The study could not be double-blind since it was not blind.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref20">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Answers may vary. Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations between variables, whether those associations represent simple or more complex relationships.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref21">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>Consider the case where your vertical axis represents something “good” and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation. Health and water consumption fit this description since water becomes toxic when consumed in excessive quantities.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref22">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Subset of data from<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref23">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p><span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> corresponds to the number of characters in the first email in the sample (21.7, in thousands), <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> to the number of characters in the second email (7.0, in thousands), and <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> corresponds to the number of characters in the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> email in the data set.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref24">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>The sample size was <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span>.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref25">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>Other ways to describe data that are skewed to the right: , , or .<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref26">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>The skew is visible in all three plots, though the flat dot plot is the least useful. The stacked dot plot and histogram are helpful visualizations for identifying skew.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref27">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>Character counts for individual emails.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref28">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>Another definition of mode, which is not typically used in statistics, is the value with the most occurrences. It is common to have <em>no</em> observations with the same value in a data set, which makes this other definition useless for many real data sets.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref29">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>Unimodal. Remember that <em>uni</em> stands for 1 (think <em>uni</em>cycles). Similarly, <em>bi</em> stands for 2 (think <em>bi</em>cycles). (We’re hoping a <em>multicycle</em> will be invented to complete this analogy.)<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref30">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>There might be two height groups visible in the data set: one of the students and one of the adults. That is, the data are probably bimodal.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref31">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>The only difference is that the population variance has a division by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref32">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>Figure [severalDiffDistWithSdOf1] shows three distributions that look quite different, but all have the same mean, variance, and standard deviation. Using modality, we can distinguish between the first plot (bimodal) and the last two (unimodal). Using skewness, we can distinguish between the last plot (right skewed) and the first two. While a picture, like a histogram, tells a more complete story, we can use modality and shape (symmetry/skew) to characterize basic information about a distribution.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref33">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>Since <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> capture the middle 50% of the data and the median splits the data in the middle, 25% of the data fall between <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and the median, and another 25% falls between the median and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref34">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref35">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>That occasionally there may be very long emails.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref36">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>These visual estimates will vary a little from one person to the next: <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\approx\)</span> 3,000, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\approx\)</span> 15,000, $=Q_3 - Q_1 $ 12,000. (The true values: <span class="math inline">\(Q_1=\)</span> 2,536, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3=\)</span> 15,411, $ = $ 12,875.)<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref37">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>(a) Mean is affected more. (b) Standard deviation is affected more. Complete explanations are provided in the material following Guided Practice [numCharWhichIsMoreRobust].<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref38">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>Buyers of a “regular car” should be concerned about the median price. High-end car sales can drastically inflate the mean price while the median will be more robust to the influence of those sales.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref39">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Statisticians often write the natural logarithm as <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span>. You might be more familiar with it being written as <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span>.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref40">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>Note: answers will vary. There is a very strong correspondence between high earning and metropolitan areas. You might look for large cities you are familiar with and try to spot them on the map as dark spots.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref41">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>0.458 represents the proportion of spam emails that had a small number. 0.058 represents the fraction of emails with small numbers that are spam.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref42">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>0.139 represents the fraction of non-spam email that had a big number. 0.908 represents the fraction of emails with big numbers that are non-spam emails.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref43">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>The column proportions in Table [colPropSpamNumber] will probably be most useful, which makes it easier to see that emails with small numbers are spam about 5.9% of the time (relatively rare). We would also see that about 27.1% of emails with no numbers are spam, and 9.2% of emails with big numbers are spam.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref44">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>Answers may vary a little. The counties with population gains tend to have higher income (median of about $45,000) versus counties without a gain (median of about $40,000). The variability is also slightly larger for the population gain group. This is evident in the IQR, which is about 50% bigger in the <em>gain</em> group. Both distributions show slight to moderate right skew and are unimodal. There is a secondary small bump at about $60,000 for the <em>no gain</em> group, visible in the hollow histogram plot, that seems out of place. (Looking into the data set, we would find that 8 of these 15 counties are in Alaska and Texas.) The box plots indicate there are many observations far above the median in each group, though we should anticipate that many observations will fall beyond the whiskers when using such a large data set.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref45">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>Answers will vary. The side-by-side box plots are especially useful for comparing centers and spreads, while the hollow histograms are more useful for seeing distribution shape, skew, and groups of anomalies.<a href="introductionToData.html#fnref46">↩</a></p></li>
