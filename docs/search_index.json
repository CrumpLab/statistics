To call in statisticians after the experiment is done may be no more than asking them to perform a post-mortem examination: They may be able to say what the experiment died of. —Sir Ronald Fisher 1.1 On the psychology of statistics Adapted nearly verbatim from Chapters 1 and 2 in Navarro, D. “Learning Statistics with R.” https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/ To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favourite part of one’s psychological education. After all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you’d probably be enrolled in a statistics class right now, not a psychology class. So, not surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn’t happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. In view of this, I thought that the right place to start might be to answer some of the more common questions that people have about stats… A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. What is it? What’s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. So let’s start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people why we do. It’s a kind of article of faith among scientists – and especially social scientists – that your findings can’t be trusted until you’ve done some stats. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for thinking that we’re all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to answer one very simple question: Why do you do statistics? Why don’t scientists just use ? It’s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There’s a lot of good answers to it, but for my money, the best answer is a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach is likely to work. In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases – some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our “gut” aren’t designed to solve scientific problems, they’re designed to handle day to day inferences – and given that biological evolution is slower than cultural change, we should say that they’re designed to solve the day to day problems for a different world than the one we live in. Most fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in “induction”, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence of the senses to make generalisations about the world. If you think that you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you. Heck, as the next section shows, we can’t even solve “deductive” problems (ones where no guessing is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases. 1.1.1 The curse of belief bias People are mostly pretty smart. We’re certainly smarter than the other species that we share the planet with (though many people might disagree). Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesn’t make us perfect though. And among the many things that psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the belief bias effect in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn’t. For instance, here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it’s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that’s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand: an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesn’t have to involve true statements. On the other hand, here’s an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn’t, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We’d expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, you’d expect to see data like this: argument is valid 100% say “valid” 100% say “valid” argument is invalid 0% say “valid” 0% say “valid” If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That is, it’d be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff. However, you guys have taken psych classes, and by now you probably know where this is going. In a classic study, ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure of the data, everything went the way you’d hope: argument is valid 92% say “valid” – argument is invalid – 8% say “valid” Not perfect, but that’s pretty good. But look what happens when our intuitive feelings about the truth of the conclusion run against the logical structure of the argument: argument is valid 92% say “valid” 46% say “valid” argument is invalid 92% say “valid” 8% say “valid” Oh dear, that’s not as good. Apparently, when people are presented with a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see that the argument is weak (people got that one wrong 92% of the time!) If you think about it, it’s not as if these data are horribly damning. Overall, people did do better than chance at compensating for their prior biases, since about 60% of people’s judgements were correct (you’d expect 50% by chance). Even so, if you were a professional “evaluator of evidence”, and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that improves your chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say) 95%, you’d probably jump at it, right? Of course you would. Thankfully, we actually do have a tool that can do this. But it’s not magic, it’s statistics. So that’s reason #1 why scientists love statistics. It’s just too easy for us to “believe what we want to believe”; so if we want to “believe in the data” instead, we’re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control. That’s what statistics does: it helps keep us honest. 1.2 The cautionary tale of Simpson’s paradox The following is a true story (I think…). In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the problem was that the gender breakdown of their admissions, which looked like this: Number of applicants Percent admitted Males 8442 44% Females 4321 35% and they were worried about being sued. Given that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a coincidence. Pretty compelling data, right? And if I were to say to you that these data actually reflect a weak bias in favour of women (sort of!), you’d probably think that I was either crazy or sexist. Earlier versions of these notes incorrectly suggested that they actually were sued – apparently that’s not true. There’s a nice commentary on this here: https://www.refsmmat.com/posts/2016-05-08-simpsons-paradox-berkeley.html. A big thank you to Wilfried Van Hirtum for pointing this out to me! When people started looking more carefully at the admissions data Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell (1975) they told a rather different story. Specifically, when they looked at it on a department by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants. The table below shows the admission figures for the six largest departments (with the names of the departments removed for privacy reasons): Department Applicants Percent admitted Applicants Percent admitted A 825 62% 108 82% B 560 63% 25 68% C 325 37% 593 34% D 417 33% 375 35% E 191 28% 393 24% F 272 6% 341 7% ———— ———— —————— ———— —————— Remarkably, most departments had a higher rate of admissions for females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How can both of these statements be true at the same time? Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., engineering, chemistry) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., English) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get A\\(&gt;\\)B\\(&gt;\\)D\\(&gt;\\)C\\(&gt;\\)F\\(&gt;\\)E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C\\(&gt;\\)E\\(&gt;\\)D\\(&gt;\\)F\\(&gt;\\)A\\(&gt;\\)B. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And in fact, if we look at all Figure [fig:berkeley] we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as Simpson’s paradox. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real. And while there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in there, I want to use it to make a much more important point …doing research is hard, and there are lots of subtle, counterintuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. That’s reason #2 why scientists love statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because science is hard, and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data. [fig:berkeley] Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. Statistics only solves partof the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the “aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that would probably put the university in the clear. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department (and there are good reasons to do that), and at the level of individual departments, the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce. That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that’s not exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in the disaggregated data. In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data, no more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but there’s no substitute for careful thought. 1.3 Statistics in psychology I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So here’s my attempt to answer a few of them… Why does psychology have so much statistics? To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly perverse people. The “things” of physics include objects like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set. At a fundamental level psychology is harder than physics. Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. There’s actually a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment”. They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. It’s not just psychology, really: most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because we’re bad experimenters, but because we’ve picked a harder problem to solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it. Can’t someone else do the statistics? To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, there’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics: There’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at least understand the basics of stats. If you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics. There’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. In almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you have to be pretty self-sufficient. Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics. I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics? Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone: we live in the 21st century, and data are everywhere. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section… 1.4 Statistics in everyday life “We are drowning in information, but we are starved for knowledge” – Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic; 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!) The point I’m trying to make here isn’t that journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it’s that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. Perhaps, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis :). 1.5 There’s more to research methods than statistics So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to the statistics part of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent. But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class. 1.6 A brief introduction to research design[ch:studydesign] To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of. – Sir Ronald Fisher In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that go into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your data collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This chapter relies heavily on for the discussion of study design, and for the discussion of scales of measurement. Later versions will attempt to be more precise in the citations. 1.6.1 Introduction to psychological measurement [sec:measurement] The first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, what we’re trying to do here is measure something about human behaviour or the human mind. What do I mean by “measurement”? 1.6.1.1 Some thoughts about psychological measurement Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement: My age is 33 years. I do not like anchovies. My chromosomal gender is male. My self-identified gender is male.1 In the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicised part is “the measurement itself”. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case: My age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what my age could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150, since no human has ever lived that long. When asked if I like anchovies, I might have said that I do, or I do not, or I have no opinion, or I sometimes do. My chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have Klinfelter’s syndrome (XXY), which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities too. My self-identified gender is also very likely to be male or female, but it doesn’t have to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with neither, or to explicitly call myself transgender. As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above, I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a developmental psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important. Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t actually all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In one sense, yes: by social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world, but from a scientific perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception, and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults, it won’t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might. Moving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” are you going to use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities: You could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age. You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception”, since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician). You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead). 1.6.1.2 Operationalisation: defining your measurement All of the ideas discussed in the previous section all relate to the concept of operationalisation. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalisation is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept, and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalisation can involve several different things: Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research? Determining what method you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question? Defining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, hours? Etc. For other types of measurements (e.g., gender), the values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options, and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers? Operationalisation is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalise the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often you’ll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general. Before moving on, I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other: A theoretical construct. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a measurement of, like “age”, “gender” or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re actually a bit vague. A measure. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure. An operationalisation. The term “operationalisation” refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct. A variable. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” that we end up with in our data sets. In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to try to understand the differences. 1.6.2 Scales of measurement[sec:scales] As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s very useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement. 1.6.2.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities: for these kinds of variables it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is ``bigger’ or “better” than any other one, and it absolutely doesn’t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an “average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it. Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when I ask 100 people how they got to work today, and I get this: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which I list the options isn’t very interesting. I could have chosen to display the data like this Transportation Number of people (3) Car 48 (1) Train 12 (4) Bicycle 10 (2) Bus 30 and nothing really changes. 1.6.2.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example given of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. As a consequence we know that 1st \\(&gt;\\) 2nd, and we know that 2nd \\(&gt;\\) 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. Here’s an more psychologically interesting example. Suppose I’m interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and I ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising, because of human activity Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering, in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a reasonable match, statement 3 isn’t a very good match, and statement 4 is in strong opposition to the science. So, in terms of the thing I’m interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as \\(1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4\\). Since this ordering exists, it would be very weird to list the options like this… Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are rising, because of human activity Temperatures are not rising Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why …because it seems to violate the natural “structure” to the question. So, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions, and got the following answers: Number (1) Temperatures are rising, because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together, and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said…what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can’t do is average them. For instance, in my simple example here, the “average” response to the question is 1.97. If you can tell me what that means, I’d love to know. Because that sounds like gibberish to me! 1.6.2.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between \\(7^\\circ\\) and \\(10^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables. However, notice that the \\(0^\\circ\\) does not mean “no temperature at all”: it actually means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as \\(10^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that \\(20^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as \\(-10^\\circ\\). Again, lets look at a more psychological example. Suppose I’m interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, I’m going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all. 1.6.2.4 Ratio scale The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take \\(3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8\\) seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took \\(3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35\\) times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really does mean “no time at all”. 1.6.2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables [sec:continuousdiscrete] There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle. These definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in between, by taking 3.0 seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table [tab:scalescont] summarises the relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. I’m trying to hammer this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very unfortunate. [tab:scalescont] The relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. continuous discrete nominal ordinal interval ratio 1.6.2.6 Some complexities Okay, I know you’re going to be shocked to hear this, but …the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” … and then the options presented to the participant are these: (1) Strongly disagree (2) Disagree (3) Neither agree nor disagree (4) Agree (5) Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too: (1) Strongly disagree (2) (3) (4) (5) Strongly agree Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete, since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they’re not ratio scale either, since there’s no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t really prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life it’s pretty obvious that they’re not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. 1.6.3 Assessing the reliability of a measurement [sec:reliability] At this point we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalise a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure; and we’ve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. In this section I’ll talk about reliability; we’ll talk about validity in the next chapter. Reliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if I step on and off the scales over and over again, it’ll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of “asking my mum” is very unreliable: some days she tells me I’m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I’m a complete moron. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to it’s validity). If I’m holding a sack of potatos when I step on and off of the bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, while my mum’s estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I’m just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it’s basically right. So that would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, to some extent, notice that if my mum’s estimates are too unreliable, it’s going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity. Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability: Test-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get a the same answer? Inter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer? Parallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight, does it give the same answer? Internal consistency reliability. If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers. Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach, Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes; so the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measure the same thing! 1.6.4 The “role” of variables: predictors and outcomes [sec:ivdv] Okay, I’ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you before moving away from variables. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. It’s important to keep the two roles “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained” distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it’s going to happen over and over again. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable \\(Y\\), and denote the variables “doing the explaining” as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc. Now, when we doing an analysis, we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study “properly” then \\(X\\) isn’t dependent on anything else. However, I personally find those names horrible: they’re hard to remember and they’re highly misleading, because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. And in fact, because I’m not the only person who thinks that IV and DV are just awful names, there are a number of alternatives that I find more appealing. The terms that I’ll use in these notes are predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that what you’re trying to do is use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes). This is summarised in Table [tab:ivdv]. [tab:ivdv] The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. Note that this book will tend to avoid the classical terminology in favour of the newer names. role of the variable classical name modern name “to be explained” dependent variable (DV) outcome “to do the explaining” independent variable (IV) predictor 1.6.5 Experimental and non-experimental research [sec:researchdesigns] One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between “experimental research” and “non-experimental research”. When we make this distinction, what we’re really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study. 1.6.5.1 Experimental research The key features of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (IVs), and then allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs) to see if they have any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that there’s no chance that something other than the predictor variables is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way “balanced” to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is randomisation: that is, we randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). We’ll talk more about randomisation later in this course, but for now, it’s enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise (but not eliminate) the chances that there are any systematic difference between groups. Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke, and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters: for instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, not by smoking per se. In technical terms, these other things (e.g. diet) are called “confounds”, and we’ll talk about those in just a moment. In the meantime, let’s now consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, if we randomly divide participants into two groups, and force half of them to become smokers, then it’s very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, then we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers. 1.6.5.2 Non-experimental research Non-experimental research is a broad term that covers “any study in which the researcher doesn’t have quite as much control as they do in an experiment”. Obviously, control is something that scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates, there are lots of situations in which you can’t or shouldn’t try to obtain that control. Since it’s grossly unethical (and almost certainly criminal) to force people to smoke in order to find out if they get cancer, this is a good example of a situation in which you really shouldn’t try to obtain experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our “smoking experiment” does have a few other issues. For instance, when I suggested that we “force” half of the people to become smokers, I must have been talking about starting with a sample of non-smokers, and then forcing them to become smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets, and suppose also that people who normally smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the “smokers” in our experiment aren’t “natural” smokers (i.e., we forced non-smokers to become smokers; they didn’t take on all of the other normal, real life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess) they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example they wouldn’t get lung cancer, and our experiment will fail, because it violates the structure of the “natural” world (the technical name for this is an “artifactual” result; see later). One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between quasi-experimental research and case studies. The example I discussed earlier – in which we wanted to examine incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers, without trying to control who smokes and who doesn’t – is a quasi-experimental design. That is, it’s the same as an experiment, but we don’t control the predictors (IVs). We can still use statistics to analyse the results, it’s just that we have to be a lot more careful. The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a few instances. In general, you can’t use statistics to analyse the results of case studies, and it’s usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about “people in general” from a few isolated examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations where you don’t have any alternative: neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just can’t find a lot of people with brain damage in a specific area, so the only thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much care as you can. However, there’s also some genuine advantages to case studies: because you don’t have as many people to study, you have the ability to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We won’t talk much about case studies in these lectures, but they are nevertheless very valuable tools! 1.6.6 Assessing the validity of a study [sec:validity] More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea behind validity is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice it’s much harder to check validity than it is to check reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there’s lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises it’s own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I’m going to talk about five different types: Internal validity External validity Construct validity Face validity Ecological validity To give you a quick guide as to what matters here…(1) Internal and external validity are the most important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. (2) Construct validity asks whether you’re measuring what you think you are. (3) Face validity isn’t terribly important except insofar as you care about “appearances”. (4) Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot. 1.6.6.1 Internal validity Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except… the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables. 1.6.6.2 External validity External validity relates to the generalisability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalise to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity. The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers don’t care only about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity. That said, it is absolutely critical to realise that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I’ll talk about this again later, but it’s such a common mistake that I’m going to mention it here. The external validity is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicised part is the bit that lots of people forget: it is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psych students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon that you’re studying, then there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here’s two extreme examples: You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity. You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing: People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life. Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life. 1.6.6.3 Construct validity Construct validity is basically a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t. To give very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose I’m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while I’m trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat” what I’m actually measuring is “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity. 1.6.6.4 Face validity Face validity simply refers to whether or not a measure “looks like” it’s doing what it’s supposed to, nothing more. If I design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and they say “no, that test doesn’t measure intelligence”, then the measure lacks face validity. It’s as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isn’t very important from a pure scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what it’s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what it’s supposed to do. As a consequence, we generally don’t care very much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes: Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a “hunch” that a particular measure won’t work. While these sorts of hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it’s often worth paying attention to them. Because often times people have knowledge that they can’t quite verbalise, so there might be something to worry about even if you can’t quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticises the face validity of your study, it’s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. Mind you, if you don’t find any reason for concern, then you should probably not worry: after all, face validity really doesn’t matter much. Often (very often), completely uninformed people will also have a “hunch” that your research is crap. And they’ll criticise it on the internet or something. On close inspection, you’ll often notice that these criticisms are actually focused entirely on how the study “looks”, but not on anything deeper. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further. Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g., this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policy makers of something or other) then you have to care about face validity. Simply because – whether you like it or not – a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific, psychological grounds, then it won’t matter how good your studies “really” are. If they lack face validity, you’ll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, it’s somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but that’s how things go. 1.6.6.5 Ecological validity Ecological validity is a different notion of validity, which is similar to external validity, but less important. The idea is that, in order to be ecologically valid, the entire set up of the study should closely approximate the real world scenario that is being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity – it relates mostly to whether the study “looks” right, but with a bit more rigour to it. To be ecologically valid, the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It’s no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that it’s much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. An simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with fairly simple array of faces to look at rather than a line up. The length of time between seeing the “criminal” and being asked to identify the suspect in the “line up” is usually shorter. The “crime” isn’t real, so there’s no chance that the witness being scared, and there’s no police officers present, so there’s not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity. 1.6.7 Confounds, artifacts and other threats to validity If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are confounds and artifact. These two terms are defined in the following way: Confound: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it, etc. Artifact: A result is said to be “artifactual” if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artifact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalise your results to the actual population that you care about. As a general rule confounds are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because they’re not proper experiments: by definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing. However, there’s always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artifacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artifactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realise that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds) but because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild” you reduce the chances of getting an artifactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artifact. Be warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artifactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g., see “differential attrition”). Okay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterised as a confound or an artifact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples… 1.6.7.1 History effects History effects refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen in between a pre-test and a post-test. Or, in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects: You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you’re still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December. You’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants. 1.6.7.2 Maturation effects As with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects: When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works. When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment 1.6.7.3 Repeated testing effects An important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include: Learning and practice: e.g., “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session. Familiarity with the testing situation: e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like. Auxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1. 1.6.7.4 Selection bias Selection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you’re in a lot of trouble. 1.6.7.5 Differential attrition One quite subtle danger to be aware of is called differential attrition, which is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, I manage to find the perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. I start running “Dan’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” on my perfect sample, but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. I can’t stop this: as we’ll discuss later in the chapter on research ethics, participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that “Dan’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high drop out rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly, the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom etc than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my results. When thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the differential attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that you’ll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases: in other words, you lose external validity. The second type of differential attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, you also have to worry about your internal validity too. To see why this is the case, let’s consider a very dumb study in which I want to see if insulting people makes them act in a more obedient way. Why anyone would actually want to study that I don’t know, but let’s suppose I really, deeply cared about this. So, I design my experiment with two conditions. In the “treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less co-operative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this drop out isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be the people who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient: it makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot. 1.6.7.6 Non-response bias Non-response bias is closely related to selection bias, and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalise from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem. 1.6.7.7 Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance. Here’s an example. Suppose I’m interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psych I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university, even though they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve got a big class, there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to not make any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the thing: intelligence and hard work are transferrable from one class to the next. Luck isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That’s the very definition of “luck”. The consequence of this is that, when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average, but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse; but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should expect (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artifact caused by regression to the mean &lt;see&gt;[for discussion]Kahneman1973. 1.6.7.8 Experimenter bias Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not – either the right answer to the questions being asked, or knowledge of the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in, and so on. The classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907 Pfungst (1911; Hothersall 2004). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count, and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs. The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in, or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it’s important to recognise that it’s not quite ideal, and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that I could try to construct a double blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students (one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student) doesn’t know anything. Except, that last part is very unlikely to be true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study effectively, they need to have been briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me, and knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this, it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an effect: suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion effect”: if you expect great things of people, they’ll rise to the occasion; but if you expect them to fail, they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophesy. 1.6.7.9 Demand effects and reactivity When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these effect people’s behaviour Rosenthal (1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching/studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago &lt;see&gt;Adair1984. A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied, rather than the lighting. To get a bit more specific about some of the ways in which the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment, but might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world: The good participant tries to be too helpful to the researcher: he or she seeks to figure out the experimenter’s hypotheses and confirm them. The negative participant does the exact opposite of the good participant: he or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way. The faithful participant is unnaturally obedient: he or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting. The apprehensive participant gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural, or overly socially desirable. 1.6.7.10 Placebo effects The placebo effect is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials: if you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t treated at all. In other words, it is people’s belief that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug. 1.6.7.11 Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects In some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for “all other threats to external validity”. They refer to the fact that the choice of subpopulation from which you draw your participants, the location, timing and manner in which you run your study (including who collects the data) and the tools that you use to make your measurements might all be influencing the results. Specifically, the worry is that these things might be influencing the results in such a way that the results won’t generalise to a wider array of people, places and measures. 1.6.7.12 Fraud, deception and self-deception It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it. – Upton Sinclair One final thing that I feel like I should mention. While reading what the textbooks often have to say about assessing the validity of the study, I couldn’t help but notice that they seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not. Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias – it’s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research, and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally “slanted”. I opened a few standard textbooks and didn’t find much of a discussion of this problem, so here’s my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can arise are: Data fabrication. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth, and may actually reflect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research). Hoaxes. Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There’s quite a few well known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g., Piltdown man) some of were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g., the Sokal affair). Data misrepresentation. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this, I’m not referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). I’m referring to the fact that often, the data don’t actually say what the researchers think they say. My guess is that, almost always, this isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty, it’s due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson’s paradox that I discussed in the beginning of these notes. It’s very common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind; and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself, you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There’s a lot of variants on this; many of which are very hard to detect. Study “misdesign”. Okay, this one is subtle. Basically, the issue here is that a researcher designs a study that has built-in flaws, and those flaws are never reported in the paper. The data that are reported are completely real, and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect, and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it “easy” to (artifactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this – in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself – is to design an experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want, you can add all the trappings of double blind experimentation etc. It won’t make a difference, since the study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results, the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader: what’s obvious to the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way I’ve described this makes it sound like it’s always fraud: probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes …and so the study just happens to end up with a built in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication. Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesising. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less lie about what they found is by engaging in what’s referred to as “data mining”. As we’ll discuss later in the class, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, you’ll eventually find something that “looks” like a real effect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers, it’s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it, the bigger the risk you’re taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher run every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data, to cover up the data mining. To be clear: it’s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data, and to reanalyse your data using your new “post hoc” hypotheses. What is wrong (and, I suspect, common) is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done so. If you acknowledge that you did it, then other researchers are able to take your behaviour into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behaviour deceptive. Bad! Publication bias &amp; self-censoring. Finally, a pervasive bias is “non-reporting” of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every article that is submitted to them: they prefer to publish articles that find “something”. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity. This is an example of a publication bias: since no-one ever published the 19 studies that didn’t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers “internalise” this bias, and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of mine says “for every experiment that you get published, you also have 10 failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up) others might be genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good” experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by with the depressing title “Why most published research findings are false”. I’d also suggest taking a look at work by presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology. There’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. What I really want to point out is the blindingly obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren’t usually that naive, but for some reason the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype. 1.6.8 Summary This chapter isn’t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological research methods: it would require another volume just as long as this one to do justice to the topic. However, in real life statistics and study design are tightly intertwined, so it’s very handy to discuss some of the key topics. In this chapter, I’ve briefly discussed the following topics: Introduction to psychological measurement (Section [sec:measurement]). What does it mean to operationalise a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements? Scales of measurement and types of variables (Section [sec:scales]). Remember that there are two different distinctions here: there’s the difference between discrete and continuous data, and there’s the difference between the four different scale types (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio). Reliability of a measurement (Section [sec:reliability]). If I measure the “same” thing twice, should I expect to see the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the “same” thing? Well, that’s why we have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are. Terminology: predictors and outcomes (Section [sec:ivdv]). What roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc. Experimental and non-experimental research designs (Section [sec:researchdesigns]). What makes an experiment an experiment? Is it a nice white lab coat, or does it have something to do with researcher control over variables? Validity and its threats (Section [sec:validity]). Does your study measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? And is it my imagination, or was that a very long list of possible ways in which things can go wrong? All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of research methodology.

Tukey Chapter by Matthew Crump This chapter is about descriptive statistics. These are tools for describing data. Some things to keep in mind as we go along are: There are lots of different ways to describe data There is more than one “correct” way, and you get to choose the most “useful” way for the data that you are describing It is possible to invent new ways of describing data, all of the ways we discuss were previously invented by other people, and they are commonly used because they are useful. Describing data is necessary because there is usually too much of it, so it doesn’t make any sense by itself. 2.1 This is what too many numbers looks like Let’s say you wanted to konw how happy people are. So, you ask thousands of people on the street how happy they are. You let them pick any number they want from negative infinity to positive infinity. Then you record all the numbers. Now what? Well, how about you look at the numbers and see if that helps you determine anything about how happy people are. What could the numbers look like. Perhaps something like this: -584 -738 -291 -480 486 395 -348 -81 -307 -200 -305 -385 -205 -139 -178 461 725 5 91 604 -896 32 -225 257 1268 699 -188 256 1370 57 238 401 486 5 937 563 926 -192 -14 -23 -92 251 -148 78 -464 -90 1045 335 -325 -686 798 210 486 -631 743 90 166 59 411 606 506 387 -278 -693 808 -443 409 327 621 749 536 -526 -29 3 581 330 630 196 1092 250 166 401 654 -97 -371 4 811 131 -519 589 85 605 270 136 835 358 -220 242 961 -412 550 -646 -348 -82 476 329 394 694 -689 502 1090 941 577 81 234 -793 530 345 368 32 734 -390 291 881 -70 425 -427 -87 544 517 960 289 738 974 466 246 439 303 216 177 79 -304 -459 685 31 210 188 1067 72 542 330 774 345 403 319 -63 -10 -192 615 374 45 534 -558 489 -442 -136 80 570 -191 510 675 -862 485 660 -146 192 -391 358 1121 231 202 -434 8 135 -554 476 22 -485 667 536 -153 823 155 1311 740 -383 163 -550 -94 501 724 -132 512 -31 -273 741 576 -6 104 -30 302 -68 -280 312 -40 -684 291 140 894 757 -797 -447 1058 180 -727 619 3 -17 747 -138 -214 -271 -551 389 665 -564 -66 965 554 -339 -55 127 931 87 144 243 -450 514 -427 -346 81 705 560 -495 500 614 -976 989 220 -63 -302 371 -7 -26 -1140 762 533 71 -145 -6 -2 864 419 469 1513 671 329 -118 245 86 350 913 738 123 -398 271 -29 -515 544 -699 -224 -304 505 -117 -319 -921 827 -617 334 787 91 195 330 -694 380 716 -320 -309 1367 -451 -494 -954 472 -79 -516 738 405 32 511 442 -349 140 -217 103 150 1235 509 -74 -122 -226 -261 -954 54 -37 1276 -582 -23 -506 351 288 -287 334 277 1134 188 150 -101 365 83 584 482 255 63 -197 701 -82 820 -950 -223 -588 -324 441 -214 1017 362 657 -122 262 373 87 189 310 157 578 323 157 -618 -963 663 326 13 895 273 217 -130 31 162 -568 -193 306 701 18 302 288 1343 298 176 1344 -433 -359 928 -761 -710 123 725 76 38 -125 922 436 -114 -289 -165 -708 104 665 945 -243 381 -434 -753 356 934 -794 -17 304 -605 432 -229 611 98 157 389 -27 489 -918 471 1015 662 -650 -814 892 731 174 559 890 259 -184 141 243 61 513 -33 448 -327 -274 -235 229 -408 -808 476 -94 -60 -824 -793 60 566 616 -323 -104 662 -395 -19 328 -216 152 -348 -119 386 -263 216 45 583 -25 610 293 -707 450 -1125 41 1047 38 697 588 347 -533 521 -178 -212 -128 Now, what are you going to with that big pile of numbers? Look at it all day long?. When you deal with data, it will deal so many numbers to you that you will be overwhelmed by them. That is why we need ways to describe the data in a more manageable fashion. The complete description on the data is always the data itself. Descriptive statistics and other tools for describing data go one step further to summarize aspects of the data. Summaries are a way to compress the important bits of a thing down to a useful and manageable tidbit. It’s like telling your friends why they should watch a movie. When they ask what it is about, you don’t replay the entire movie for them, instead you hit the highlights. Summarizing the data is just like a movie preview, only for data. 2.2 Look at the data We already tried one way of looking at the numbers, and it wasn’t useful. Let’s look at some other ways of looking at the numbers in graphs. Graphing data by putting them in plots or figures can help us see the data. 2.2.1 Stop, plotting time (o o oh) U can plot this Let’s turn all of the numbers into dots, then show them in a graph. Note, when we do this we have not yet summarized anything about the data. Instead, in this step we just look at all of the data in a visual format, rather than looking at the numbers. Figure 2.1: Pretend happiness ratings from 500 people Figure 2.1 shows 500 measurements of happiness. The graph has two axes. The horizontal x-axis, going from left to right is labeled “Index”. The vertical y-axis, going up and down, is labelled “happiness”. Each dot represents one measurement of every person’s happiness from our pretend study. Before we talk about what we can and cannot see about the data, it is worth mentioning that the way you plot the data will make some things easier to see and some things harder to see. So, what can we now see about the data? There are lots of dots everywhere. It looks like there are 500 of them because the index goes to 500. It looks like some dots go as high as 1000-1500 and as low as -1500. It looks like there are more dots in the middleish area of the plot, sort of spread about 0. Take home: we can see all the numbers at once by putting them in a plot, and that is much easier and more helpful than looking at the raw numbers. Ok, so if these dots represent how happy 500 people are, what can we say about those people? First, the dots are kind of all over the place, so different people have different levels of happiness. Are there any trends? Are more people happy than unhappy, or vice versa? It’s hard to see that in the graph, so let’s make a different one, called a histogram 2.2.2 Histograms Making a histogram will be our first act of officially summarizing something about the data. We will no longer the individual bits of data, instead we will see how the numbers group together. Let’s look at a histogram of the happiness data, and then explain it. Figure 2.2: A histrogram of the happiness ratings The dots have disappeared, and now we some bars. Each bar is a summary of the dots, representing the number of dots (frequency count) inside a particular range of happiness, also called bins. For example, how many people gave a happiness rating between 0 and 500? Well, the fifth bar, the one between 0 and 500 and the x-xaxis, tells you how many? Look how tall that bar is. How tall is it? Well, the height is shown on the y-axis, which provides a frequency count (the number of dots or data points). It looks like around 150 people sad their happiness was between 0-500. More generally, we see there are many bins on the x-axis. We have divided the data into bins of 500. Bin #1 goes from -2000 to -1500, bin #2 goes from -1500 to -1000, and so until the last bin. To make the histogram, we just count up the number of data points falling inside each bin, then plot those frequency counts as a function of the bins. Voila, a histogram. What does the histogram help us see about the data? First, we can see the shape of data. The shape of the histogram refers to how it goes up and down. The shape tells us where the data is. For example, when the bars are low we know there isn’t much data there. When the bars are high, we know there is more data there. So, where is most of the data? It looks like it’s mostly in the middle two bins, between -500 and 500. We can also see the range of the data. This tells us the minimums and the maximums of the data. Most of the data is between -1500 and +1500, so no infite sadness or infinite happiness in our dataset. 2.3 Important Ideas: Distribution, Central Tendency, and Variance Let’s introduce a three important terms we will use alot, distribution, central tendency, and variance. These terms are similar to their everyday meanings (although I suspect most people don’t say central tendency very often). Distribution. When you order something from Amazon, where does it come from, and how does it get to your place? That stuff comes from one of Amazon’s distribution centers. They distribute all sorts of things by spreading them around to your doorstep. Distribute is spreading something. Notice, the histogram, distributes the data by spreading the numbers across the bins. We can also talk about a distribution as a noun. The histogram is a distribution of the frequency counts across the bins. Distributions are very, very, very, very, very important. They can have many different shapes. They can describe data, like in the histogram above. And as we will learn in later chapters, they can produce data. Many times we will be asking questions about where our data came from, and this usually means asking what kind of distribution could have created our data (more on that later.) Central Tendency is all about sameness. Is there anything similar about all of the numbers in the histogram? Yes, we can say that most of them are near 0. There is a tendency for most of the numbers to be centered near 0. Notice we are being cautious about our generalization about the numbers. We are not saying they are all 0. We are saying there is a tendency for many of them to be near zero. There are lots of ways to talk about the central tendency of some numbers. There can even be more than one kind of tendency. For example, if lots of the numbers were around -1000, and a simlar large amount of numbers were grouped around 1000, we could say there was two tendencies. Variance is all about differentness. Is there anything different about all of the numbers in the histogram? YES!!! The numbers are not all the same! When the numbers are not all the same, they must vary. So, the variance in the numbers refers to how the numbers are different. There are many ways to summarize the amount of variance in the numbers, and we discuss these very soon. 2.4 Measures of Central Tendency (Sameness) We’ve seen that we can get a sense of data by plotting dots in a graph, and by making a histogram. These tools show us what the numbers look like, approximately how big and small they are, and how similar and different they are from another. It is good to get a feeling about the numbers in this way. But, these visual sensitudes are not very precise. In addition to summarizing numbers with graphs, we can summarize numbers using numbers (NO, please not more numbers, we promise numbers can be your friend). 2.4.1 From many numbers to one Measures of central have one important summary goal: to reduce a pile of numbers to a single number that we can look at. We already know looking at thousands of numbers is hopeless. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just look at one number instead? We think so. It turns out there are lots of ways to do this. Then, if your friend ever asks the frightening question, “hey, what are all these numbers like?”. You can say they are like this one number right here. But, just like in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (highly recommended movie), you must choose your measure of central tendency wisely. 2.4.2 Mode The mode is the most frequently occuring number in your measurement. That is it. How do you find it? You have count the number of times each number appears in your measure, then whichever one occurs the most, is the mode. Example: 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 The mode of the above set is 1, which occurs three times. Every other number only occurs once. Ok fine. What happens here: Example: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 Hmmm, now 1 and 2 both occur three times each. What do we do? We say there are two modes, and they are 1 and 2. Why is the mode a measure of central tendency? Well, when we ask, “what are my numbers like”, we can say, “most of the number are, like a 1 (or whatever the mode is)”. Is the mode a good measure of central tendency? Well, that depends on your numbers. For example, consider these numbers 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Here, the mode is 1 again, because there are two 1s, and all of the other numbers occur once. But, are most of the numbers like, a 1. No, they are mostly not 1s. “Argh, so should I or should I not use the mode? I thought this class was supposed to tell me what to do?”. There is no telling you what to do. Everytime you use a tool in statistics you have to think about what you are doing and justify why what you are doing makes sense. Sorry. 2.4.3 Median The median is the exact middle of the data. After all, we are asking about central tendency, so why not go to the center of the data and see where we are. What do you mean middle of the data? Let’s look at these numbers: 1 5 4 3 6 7 9 Umm, ok. So, three is in the middle? Isn’t that kind of arbitrary. Yes. Before we can compute the median, we need to order the numbers from smallest to largest. 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 Now, 5 is in the middle. And, by middle we mean in the middle. There are three numbers to the left of 5, and three numbers to the right. So, five is definetely in the middle. Ok fine, but what happens when there aren’t an even number of numbers? Then the middle will be missing right? let’s see 1 2 3 4 5 6 There is no number between 3 and 4, the middle is empty. In this case, we compute the median by figuring out the number in between 3 and 4. So, the median would be 3.5. Is the median a good measure of central tendency? Sure, it is often very useful. One property of the median is that it stays in the middle even when some of the other numbers get really weird. For example, consider these numbers: 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 7 1000 Most of these numbers are smallish, but the 1000 is a big old weird number, very different from the rest. The median is still 5, because it is in the middle of these ordered numbers. We can also see that five is pretty similar to most of the numbers (except for 1000). So, the median does a pretty good job of representing most of the numbers in the set, and it does so even if one or two of the numbers are very different from the others. Finally, outlier is a term will we use to describe numbers that appear in data that are very different from the rest. 1000 is an outlier, because it lies way out there on the number compared to the other numbers. What to do with outliers is another topic we cover later in the book. 2.4.4 Mean Have you noticed this is a textbook about statistics that hasn’t used a formula yet? That is about to change, but for those of you with formula anxiety, don’t worry, we will do our best to explain them. The mean is also called the average. And, we’re guessing you might already now what the average of a bunch of numbers is? It’s the sum of the numbers, divided by the number of number right? How do we express that idea in a formula? Just like this: \\(Mean = \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{N}\\) “That looks like Greek to me”. Yup. The \\(\\sum\\) symbol is calleged sigma, and it stands for the operation of summing. The little “i” on the bottom, and the little “n” on the top refers to all of the numbers in the set, from the first number “i” to the last number “n”. The letters are just arbitrary labels, called variables that we use for descriptive purposes. The \\(x_{i}\\) refers to individual numbers in the set. We sum up all of the numbers, then divide the sum by \\(N\\), which is the total number of numbers. Sometime you will see \\(\\bar{X}\\) to refer to the mean of all of the numbers inside \\(X_{i}\\), which refers to all of our numbers. In plain english, the formula looks like: \\(mean = \\frac{\\text{Sum of my numbers}}{\\text{Count of my numbers}}\\) “Well, why didn’t you just say that?”. We just did. Let’s compute the mean for these five numbers: 3 7 9 2 6 Add em up: 3+7+9+2+6 = 27 Count em up: \\(i_{1}\\) = 3, \\(i_{2}\\) = 7, \\(i_{3}\\) = 9, \\(i_{4}\\) = 2, \\(i_{5}\\) = 6; N=5, because \\(i\\) went from 1 to 5 Divide em: mean = 27 / 5 = 5.4 Or, to put the numbers in the formula, it looks like this: \\(Mean = \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{N} = \\frac{3+7+9+2+6}{5} = \\frac{27}{5} = 5.4\\) Ok fine, that is how to compute the mean. But, like we imagined, you probably already knew that, and if you didn’t that’s ok, now you do. What’s next? Is the mean a good measure of central tendency? You should know now the answer to this question is: it depends. 2.4.5 What does the mean mean? It is not enough to know the formula for the mean, or to be able to use the formula to compute a mean for a set of numbers. We believe in your ability to add and divide numbers. What you really need to know is what the mean really “means”. This requires that you know what the mean does, and not just how to do it. Puzzled? Let’s explain. Can you answer this question: What happens when you divide a sum of numbers by the number of numbers? What are the consequences of doing this? What is the formula doing? What kind of properties does the result give us? FYI, the answer is not that we compute the mean. Ok, so what happens when you divide any number by another number? Of course, the key word here is divide. We literally carve the number up top in the numerator into pieces. How many times do we split the top number? That depends on the bottom number in the denominator. Watch: \\(\\frac{12}{3} = 4\\) So, we know the answer is 4. But, what is really going on here is that we are slicing and dicing up 12 aren’t we. The answer 4 tells us that we can slice and dice 12 up into three perfect pieces. So, now we are thinking of 12 as three different pieces \\(= 4 + 4 + 4\\). I know this will be obvious, but what kind of properties do our pieces have? You mean the fours? Yup. Well, obviously they are all fours. Yes. The pieces are all the same size. They are all equal. So, division equalizes the numerator by the denominator… “Umm, I think I learned this in elementary school, what does this have to do with the mean?”. The number on top of the formula for the mean is just another numerator being divided by a denominator isn’t it. In this case, the numerator is a sum of all the values in your data. What if it was the sum of all of the happiness ratings? We saw earlier that there were 500 people gave different ratings. The sum of all of them would just be a single number adding up all the different ratings. If we split the sum up into equal parts representing one part for each person’s happiness what would we get? We would get 500 identical and equal numbers for each person. It would be like taking all of the happiness in the world, then dividing it up equally, then to be fair, giving back the same equal amount of happiness to everyone in the world. This would make some people more happy than they were before, and some people less happy right. Of course, that’s because it would be equalizing the distribution of happiness for everybody. This process of equalization by dividing something into equal parts is what the mean does. See, it’s more than just a formula. It’s an idea. This is just the beginning of thinking about these kinds of ideas. We will come back to this idea about the mean, and other ideas, in later chapters. Pro tip: The mean is the one and only number that can take the place of every number in the data, such that when you add up all the equal parts, you get back the original sum of the data. 2.5 Measures of Variation (Differentness) What did you do when you wrote essay’s in high school about a book you read? Probably compare and contrast something right? When you summarize data, you do the same thing. Measures of central tendency give us something like comparing does, it tells us stuff about what is the same. Measures of Variation give us something like contrasting does, it tells us stuff about what is different. First, we note that whenever you see a bunch of numbers that aren’t the same, you already know there are some differences. This means the numbers vary, and there is variation in the size of the numbers. 2.5.1 The Range Consider these 10 numbers, that I already ordered from smallest to largest for you: 1 5 4 3 6 5 7 8 9 24 The numbers have variation, because they are not all the same. We can use the range to describe the width of the variation. The range refers to the minimum (smallest value) and maximum (largest value) in the set. So, the range would be 1 and 24. The range is a good way to quickly summarize the boundaries of your data in just two numbers. By computing the range we know that none of the data is larger or smaller than the range. And, it can alert you to outliers. For example, if you are expecting your numbers to be between 1 and 7, but you find the range is 1 - 340,500, then you know you have some big numbers that shouldn’t be there, and then you can try to figure out why those numbers occured (and potentially remove them if something went wrong). 2.5.2 The Difference Scores It would be nice to summarize the amount of differentness in the data. Here’s why. If you thought that raw data (lots of numbers) is too big to look at, then you will be frightened to contemplate how many differences there are to look at. For example, these 10 numbers are easy to look at: 1 5 4 3 6 5 7 8 9 24 But, what about the difference between the numbers, what do those look like? We can compute the difference scores between each number, then put them in a matrix like the one below: 1 5 4 3 6 5 7 8 9 24 1 0 4 3 2 5 4 6 7 8 23 5 -4 0 -1 -2 1 0 2 3 4 19 4 -3 1 0 -1 2 1 3 4 5 20 3 -2 2 1 0 3 2 4 5 6 21 6 -5 -1 -2 -3 0 -1 1 2 3 18 5 -4 0 -1 -2 1 0 2 3 4 19 7 -6 -2 -3 -4 -1 -2 0 1 2 17 8 -7 -3 -4 -5 -2 -3 -1 0 1 16 9 -8 -4 -5 -6 -3 -4 -2 -1 0 15 24 -23 -19 -20 -21 -18 -19 -17 -16 -15 0 We are looking at all of the possible differences between each number and every other number. So, in the top left, the difference between 1 and itself is 0. One column over to the right, the difference between 5 and 1 (5-1) is 4, etc. As you can see, this is a 10x10 matrix, which means there are 100 differences to look at. Not too bad, but if we had 500 numbers, then we would have 500*500 = 250,000 differences to look at (go for it if you like looking at that sort of thing). Pause for a simple question. What would this matrix look like if all of the 10 numbers in our data were the same number? It should look like a bunch of 0s right? Good. In that case, we could easily see that the numbers have no variation. But, when the numbers are different, we can see that there is a very large matrix of difference scores. How can we summarize that? How about we apply what we learned from the previous section on measures of central tendency. We have a lot of differences, so we could ask something like, what is the average difference that we have? So, we could just take all of our differences, and compute the mean difference right? What do you think would happen if we did that? Let’s try it out on these three numbers: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 0 1 2 2 -1 0 1 3 -2 -1 0 You might already guess what is going to happen. Let’s compute the mean: \\(\\text{mean of difference scores} = \\frac{0+1+2-1+0+1-2-1+0}{9} = \\frac{0}{9} = 0\\) Uh oh, we get zero for the mean of the difference scores. This will always happen whenever you take the mean of the difference scores. We can see that there are some differences between the numbers, so using 0 as the summary value for the variation in the numbers doesn’t make much sense. Furthermore, you might also notice that the matrices of difference scores are redundant. The diagonal is always zero, and the top numbers are the same as the bottom numbers, except their signs are reversed. These are little problems that can be solved by computing the variance and the standard deviation. For now, the standard deviation is a just a trick that we use to avoid getting a zero. But, later we will see it has properties that are important for other reasons. 2.5.3 The Variance Variability, variation, variance, vary, variable, varying, variety. Confused yet? Before we describe the variance, we want to you be ok with how this word is used. First, don’t forget the big picture. We know that variability and variation refers to the big idea of differences between numbers. We can even use the word variance in the same way. When numbers are different, they have variance. The formulas for variance and standard deviation depend on whether you think your data represents an entire population of numbers, or is sample from the population. We discuss this issue in later on. For now, we divide by N, later we discuss why you will often divide by N-1 instead. The word variance also refers to a specific summary statistic, the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. Hold on what? Plain english please. The variance is the sum of the squared difference scores, where the difference scores are computed between each score and the mean. What are these scores? The scores are the numbers in the data set. Let’s see the formula in English first: \\(variance = \\frac{\\text{Sum of squared difference scores}}{\\text{Number of Scores}}\\) 2.5.3.1 Deviations from the mean, Difference scores from the mean We got a little bit complicated before when we computed the difference scores between all of the numbers in the data. Let’s do it again, but in more manageable way. This time, we calculate the difference between each score and the mean. The idea here is We can figure out how similar our scores our by computing the mean Then we can figure out how different our scores our from the mean This could tell us, 1) something about whether our scores are really all very close to the mean (which could help us know if the mean is good representative number of the data), and 2) something about how much differences there are in the numbers. Take a look at this table: scores values mean Difference_from_Mean 1 1 4.5 -3.5 2 6 4.5 1.5 3 4 4.5 -0.5 4 2 4.5 -2.5 5 6 4.5 1.5 6 8 4.5 3.5 Sums 27 27 0 Means 4.5 4.5 0 The first column shows we have 6 scores in the dataset, and the ‘value’ columns shows each score. The sum of the values, and the mean is presented on the last two rows. These values were obtained by \\(\\frac{1+6+4+2+6+8}{6} = \\frac{27}{6} = 4.5\\). The third column ‘mean’, appears a bit silly. We are just listing the mean once for every score. If you think back to our discussion about the meaning of the mean, then you will remember that it equally distributes the total sum across each datapoint. We can see that here, if we treat each score as the mean, then every score is a 4.5. We can also see that adding up all of the means for each score gives us back 27, which is the sum of the original values. Also, we see that if we find the mean of the mean scores, we get back the mean (4.5 again). All of the action is occuring in the fourth column, ‘Difference_from_Mean’. Here, we are showing the difference scores from the mean, using \\(X_{i}-\\bar{X}\\). In other words, we subtracted the mean from each score. So, the first score, 1, is -3.5 from the mean, the second score, 6, is +1.5 from the mean, and so on. Now, we can look at our original scores, and we can look at their differences from the mean. Notice, we don’t have a matrix of raw difference scores, so it is much easier to look at out. But, we still have a problem. We can see that there are non-zero values in the difference scores. But, when we add them all up, we still get zero, which makes it seem like there are a total of zero differences in the data…Why does this happen…and what to do about it? 2.5.3.2 The mean is the balancing point in the data One brief pause here to point out another wonderful property of the mean. It is the balancing point in the data. If you take a pen or pencil and try to balance it on your figure so it lays flat what are you doing. You need to find the center of mass in the pen, so that have of it is one side, and the other half is on ther other side. That’s how balancing works. One side = the other side. We can think of data as having mass or weight to it. If we put our data on our bathroom scale, we could figure out how heavy it was by summing it up. If we wanted to split the data down the middle so that half of it’s weight was equal to the other half, then we could balance the data on top of a pin. The mean of the data tells you where to put the pin. It is the location in the data, where on the one side the numbers add to the same sum as the numbers on the other side. If we think this through, it means that the sum of the difference scores from the mean will always add up to zero. This is because the numbers on one side of the mean will always add up to -x (whatever the sum of those numbers is), and the numbers of the other side of the mean will always add up to +x (which will be the same value only positive). And: \\(-x + x = 0\\), right. Right. 2.5.3.3 The squared deviations Some devious someone devined a solution to the fact that differences scores from the mean always add to zero. Can you think of any solutions? For example, what could you do to the difference scores so that you could add them up, and they would weigh something useful, that is they would not be zero? The devious solution is to square the numbers. Squaring numbers converts all the negative numbers to positive numbers. For example, \\(2^2 = 4\\), and \\(-2^2 = 4\\). Remember how squaring works, we multiply the number twice: \\(2^2 = 2*2 = 4\\), and \\(-2^2 = -2*-2 = 4\\). We use the term squared deviations to refer to differences scores that have been squared. Deviations are things that move away from something. The difference scores move away from the mean, so we also call them deviations. Let’s look at our table again, but add the squared deviations. scores values mean Difference_from_Mean Squared_Deviations 1 1 4.5 -3.5 12.25 2 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 3 4 4.5 -0.5 0.25 4 2 4.5 -2.5 6.25 5 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 6 8 4.5 3.5 12.25 Sums 27 27 0 35.5 Means 4.5 4.5 0 5.91666666666667 Ok, now we have new column called squared_deviations. These are just the difference scores squared. So, \\(-3.5^2 = 12.25\\), etc. You can confirm for yourself with your cellphone calculator. Now that all of the squared deviations are positive, we can add them up. When we do this create something very special called the sum of squares (SS), also known as the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. We will talk at length about this SS later on in the ANOVA chapter. So, when you get there, remember that you already know what it is, just some sums of some squared deviations, nothing fancy. 2.5.3.4 Finally, the variance Guess what, we already computed the variance. It already happened, and maybe you didn’t notice. “Wait, I missed that, what happened?”. First, see if you can remember what we are trying to do here. Trying pausing before reading to see you if can tell yourself what problem we are trying solve. Without further ado, we are trying to get a summary of the differences in our data. There are just as many difference scores from the mean as there are data points, which can be alot, so it would be nice to have a single number to look at, something like a mean, that would tell us about the average differences in the data. If you look at the table, you can see already computed the mean of the squared deviations. First, we found the sum (SS), then below that we calcuated the mean = 5.916 repeating. This is the variance. The variance is the mean of the sum of the squared deviations: \\(variance = \\frac{SS}{N}\\), where SS is the sum of the squared deviations, and N is the number of observations. Ok, now what. What do I do with the variance? What does this number mean? Good question. The variance is often an unhelpful number to look at. Why? Because it is not in the same scale as the original data. This is because we sqared the difference scores before taking the mean. Squaring produces large numbers. For example, we see a 12.25 in there. That’s a big difference, bigger than any difference between any two original values. What to do? How can we bring the numbers back down to their original unsquared size? If you are thinking about taking the square root, that’s a ding ding ding, correct answer for you. We can always unsquare anything by taking the square root. So, let’s do that to 5.916. \\(\\sqrt{5.916} =\\) 2.4322829. 2.5.4 The Standard Deviation Oops, we did it again. We already computed the standard deviation, and we didn’t tell you. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance…At least, it is right now, until we complicate matters for you in the next chapter. Here is the formula for the standard deviation: \\(\\text{standard deviation} = \\sqrt{Variance} = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS}{N}}\\). We could also expand this to say: \\(\\text{standard deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i}^{n}({x_{i}-\\bar{x})^2}}{N}}\\) Don’t let those big square root signs put you off. Now, you know what they are doing there. Just bringing our measure of the variance back down to the original size of the data. Let’s look at our table again: scores values mean Difference_from_Mean Squared_Deviations 1 1 4.5 -3.5 12.25 2 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 3 4 4.5 -0.5 0.25 4 2 4.5 -2.5 6.25 5 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 6 8 4.5 3.5 12.25 Sums 27 27 0 35.5 Means 4.5 4.5 0 5.91666666666667 We measured the standard deviation as 2.4322829. Notice this number fits right in the with differences scores from the mean. All of the scores are kind of in and around + or - 2.4322829. Whereas, if we looked at the variance, 5.916 is just too big, it doesn’t summarize the actual differences very well. What does all this mean? Well, if someone told they had some number with a mean of 4.5 (like the values in our table), and a standard deviation of 2.4322829, you would get a pretty good summary of the numbers. You would know that lots of the numbers are spread about 4.5, and are + or - 2.4322829 from 4.5. That’s a good start for describing numbers. If you had loads of numbers, you could reduce them down to the mean and the standard deviation, and still be pretty well off in terms of getting a sense of those numbers. 2.6 Using Descriptive Statistics with data Example here: 2.7 Rolling your own descriptive statistics We spent many paragraphs talking about variation in numbers, and how to use calculate the variance and standard deviation to summarize the average differences between numbers in a data set. The basic process was to 1) calculate some measure of the differences, then 2) average the differences to create a summary. We found that we couldn’t average the raw difference scores, because we would always get a zero. So, we squared the differencs from the mean, then averaged the squared differences differences. Finally, we square rooted our measure to bring the summary back down to the scale of the original numbers. Perhaps you haven’t heard, but there is more than one way to skin a cat, but we prefer to think of this in terms of petting cats, because some of us love cats. Jokes aside, perhaps you were also thinking that the problem of summing differences scores (so that they don’t equal zero), can be solved in more than one way. Can you think of a different way, besides squaring? 2.7.1 Absolute deviations How about just taking the absoluate value of the difference scores. Remember, the absolute value converts any number to a positive value. Check out the following table: scores values mean Difference_from_Mean Absolute_Deviations 1 1 4.5 -3.5 3.5 2 6 4.5 1.5 1.5 3 4 4.5 -0.5 0.5 4 2 4.5 -2.5 2.5 5 6 4.5 1.5 1.5 6 8 4.5 3.5 3.5 Sums 27 27 0 13 Means 4.5 4.5 0 2.16666666666667 This works pretty well too. By converting the difference scores from the mean to positive values, we can now add them up and get a non-zero value (if there are differences). Then, we can find the mean of the sum of the absolute deviations. If we were to map the terms sum of squares (SS), variance and standard deviation onto these new measures based off of the absolute deviation, how would the mapping go? For example, what value in the table corresponds to the SS? That would be the sum of absolute deviations in the last column. How about the variance and standard deviation, what do those correspond to? Remember that the variance is mean (\\(SS/N\\)), and the standard deviation is a square-rooted mean (\\(\\sqrt{SS/N}\\)). In the table above we only have one corresponding mean, the mean of the sum of the absolute deviations. So, we have a variance measure that does not need to be square rooted. We might say the mean absolute deviation, is doing double-duty as a variance and a standard-deviation. Neat. 2.7.2 Other sign-inverting operations In principle, we could create lots of different summary statistics for variance that solve the summing to zero problem. For example, we could raise every difference score to any even numbered power beyond 2 (which is the square). We could use, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc. There is an infinity of even numbers, so there is an infinity of possible variance statistics. We could also use odd numbers as powers, and then take their absolute value. Many things are possible. The important aspect to any of this is to have a reason for what you are doing, and to choose a method that works for the data-analysis problem you are tring to solve. Note also, we bring up this general issue because we want you to understand that statistics is a creative exercise. We invent things when we need them, and we use things that have already been invented when they work for the problem at hand. "],

It was too much too look at and it didn’t make sense. So, we talked about how to look at the data visually using plots and histograms, and we talked about how to summarize lots of numbers so we could determine their central tendencies (sameness) and variability (differentness). And, all was well with the world. Let’s not forget the big reason why learned about descriptive statistics. The big reason is that we are interested in getting answers to questions using data. If you are looking for a thread to think about the whole way through this big, that thread is: how do we ask an answer questions using data? For every section in this book, you should be connecting your inner monologe to this question, and asking yourself: How does what I am learning about help me answer questions with data? Advance warning, we know it is easy to forget this stuff when we dive into the details, and we will try to throw you a rope to help you out along the way. We started Chapter two with some fake data on human happiness, remember? We imagined that we asked a bunch of people to tell us how happy they were, then we looked at the numbers they gave us. Let’s continue with this imaginary thought experiment. What do you get when ask people to use a number to describe how happy they are? A bunch of numbers. What kind of questions can you ask about those numbers? Well, you can look at the numbers and estimate their general properties as we already did. We would expect to find what we can imagine to be true. There are different people, and different people are different amounts of happy. You’ve probably met some of those of really happy people, and really unhappy people, and you yourself probably have some amount of happiness. “Great, thanks captain obvious”. Before moving on, you should also be skeptical of what the numbers might mean. For example, if you force people to give a number between 0-100 to rate their happiness, does this number truly reflect how happy that person is? Can a person know how happy they are? Does the question format bias how they give their answer? Is happiness even a real thing? These are all good questions about the validity of the construct (happiness itself) and the measure (numbers) you are using to quantify it. For now, though, we will side-step those very important questions, and assume that, happiness is a thing, and our measure of happiness measures something about how happy people are. Ok then, after we have measured some happiness, I bet you can think of some more pressing questions. For example, what causes happiness to go up or down. If you knew the causes of happiness what could you do? How about increase your own happiness, or help people who are unhappy, or better appreciate why Eeyore is unhappy, or present valid scientific arguments that argue against incorrect claims about what causes happiness. A causal theory and understanding of happiness could be used for all of those things. How can we get there? Imagine you were an alien observer. You arrived on earth and heard about this thing called happiness that people have. You want to know what causes happiness. You also discover that the planet earth has lots of other things. Which of those things, you wonder, cause happiness? How to get started on this big question. As a person who has happiness, you might already have some hunches. For example things like: weather, friends, music, money, education, drugs, books, movies, perspective, personality, color of your shoes, eyebrow length, number of cat’s you see per day, frequency of subway delay, a lifetime supply of chocolate, etcetera etcetera (as Willy Wonka would say). There could be many different causes of happiness. 3.1 If something caused something else to change, what would that look like? Before we go around determining the causes of happiness, we should prepare ourselves with some analytical tools so that we could identify what causation looks like. If we don’t prepare ourselves for what we might find, then we won’t know how to interpret our own data. Instead, we need to anticipate what the data could look like. Specifically, we need to know what data would look like when one thing does not cause another thing, and what data would look like when one thing does cause another thing. This chapter does some of this preparation. Fair warning. We will find out some tricky things. For example, we can find patterns that look like one thing is causing another, even when that one thing DOES NOT CAUSE the other thing. Hang in there. 3.1.1 Charlie and the Chocolate factory Let’s imagine that a person’s supply of chocolate has a causal influence on their level of happiness. Let’s further imagine that, like Charlie, the more chocolate you have the more happy you will be, and the less chocolate you have, the less happy you will be. Finally, because we suspect happyness is caused by lots of other things in a person’s life, we anticipate that the relationship between chocolate supply and happyness won’t be perfect. What do these assumptions mean for how the data should look? Our first step is to collect some imaginary data from 100 people. We walk around and ask the first 100 people we meet to answer two questions: 1) how much chocolate do you have, and 2) how happy are you. For convenvience, both the scales will go from 0 - 100. For the chocolate scale, 0 means no chocolate, 100 means lifetime supply of chocolate, and any other number is somewhere in between. For the happiness scale, 0 means no happiness, 100 means all of the happiness, and in between means some amount in between. Here is some sample data from the first 10 imaginary subjects. subject chocolate happiness 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 4 3 4 5 4 4 6 3 6 7 4 4 8 7 7 9 7 6 10 6 7 Of course, we asked each subjects two questions, so there are two scores for each subject, one for their chocolate supply, and one for their level of happiness. You might already notice some relationships between amount of chocolate and level of happiness in the table. To make those relationships even more clear, let’s plot all of the data in a graph. 3.1.2 Scatterplots When you have two measurements worth of data, you can always turn them into dots and plot them in a scatter plot. A scatterplot has a horizontal x-axis, and a veritcal y-axis. You get to choose which measurement goes on which axis. Let’s put chocolate supply on the x-axis, and happiness level on the y-axis. The plot below shows 100 dots for each subject. You might be wondering, why are there only 100 dots for the data. Didn’t we collect 100 measures for chocolate, and 100 measures for happiness, shouldn’t there be 200 dots? Nope. Each dot is for one subject, there are 100 subjects, so there are 100 dots. What do the dots mean? Each dot has two coordinates, an x-coordinate for chocolate, and a y-coordinate for happiness. The first dot, all the way on the bottom left is the first subject in the table, who had close to 0 chocolate and close to zero happiness. You can look at any dot, then draw a straight line down to the x-xaxis: that will tell you have much chocolate that subject has. You can draw a straight line left to the y-axis: that will tell you how much happiness the subject has. Now that we are looking at the scatterplot, we can see many things. One, the dots are scattered around a bit aren’t they, hence scatterplot. Even when the dot’s don’t scatter, they’re still called scatterplots, perhaps because those pesky dots in real life have so much scatter all the time. More important, the dots show a relationship between chocolate supply and happiness. Happiness is lower for people with smaller supplies of choclate, and higher for people with larger supplies of chocolate. It looks like the more chocolate you have the happier you will be, and vice versa. This kind of relationship is called a positive correlation. 3.1.3 Positive, Negative, and No-Correlation Seeing as we are in the business of imagining data, let’s imagine some more. We’ve already imagined what data would look like if larger chocolate supplies increase happiness. We’ll show that again in a bit. What do you imagine the scatterplot would look like if the relationship was reversed, and larger chocolate supplies decreased happiness. Or, what do you imagine the scatterplot would look like if there was no relationship, and the amount of chocolate that you have doesn’t do anything to your happiness. We invite your imagination to look at these graphs: The first panel shows a negative correlation. Happiness goes down as chocolate supply increases. Negative correlation occurs when one thing goes up and the other thing goes down; or, when more of X is less of Y, and vice versa. The second panel shows a positive correlation. Happiness goes up as chocolate as chocolate supply increases. Postive correlation occurs when both things go up togetehr, and go down together: more of X is more of Y, and vice versa. The third panel shows no correlation. Here, there doesn’t appear to be any obvious relationship between chocolate supply and happiness. The dots are scattered all over the place, the truest of the scatterplots. Zero correlation occurs when one thing is not related in any way to another another. Changes in X do not relate to any changes in Y, and vice-versa. 3.2 Pearson’s r If Beyoncé was a statistician, she might look at these scatterplots and want to “put a number on it”. We think this is a good idea too. We’ve already learned how to creative descriptive statistics for a single measure, like chocolate, or happiness (i.e., means, variances, etc.). Is it possible to create a descriptive statistic that summarized the relationship between two measures, all in one number? Can it be done? Karl Pearson to the rescue. There’s a statistic for that, and Karl Pearson invented it. Everyone now calls it, “Pearson’s r”. We will find out later that Karl Pearson was a big-wig editor at Biometrika in the 1930s. He took a hating to another big-wig statisticain, Sir Ronald Fisher (who we learn about later), and they some stat fights…why can’t we all just get along in statistics. How does Pearsons’ r work? Let’s look again at the first 10 subjects in our fake experiment: subject chocolate happiness 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 4 3 4 5 4 4 6 3 6 7 4 4 8 7 7 9 7 6 10 6 7 Sums 39 42 Means 3.9 4.2 What could we do to these numbers to produce a single, summary value, that represents the relationship between the chocolate supply and happiness? 3.2.1 The idea of co-variance “Oh please no, don’t use the word variance again”. Yes, we’re doing it, we’re going to use the word variance again, and again, until it starts making sense. Remember what variance means about some numbers. It means the numbers have some change in them, they are not all the same, some of them are big, some are small. We can see that there is variance in chocolate supply across the 10 subjects. We can see that there is variance in happiness across the 10 subjects. We also saw in the scatterplot, that happiness increases as chocolate supply increases; which is a positive relationship, a positive correlation. What does this have to do with variance? Well, it means there is a relationship between the variance in chocolate supply, and the variance in happiness levels. The two measures vary together don’t they? When we have two measures that vary together, they are like a happy couple who share their variance. This is what co-variance refers to, the idea that the pattern of varying numbers in one measure is shared by the pattern of varying numbers in another measure. Co-variance is very, very, very ,very important. We suspect that the word co-variance is initially confusing, especially if you are not yet fully comfortable with the meaning of variance for a single measure. Nevertheless, we must proceed and use the idea of co-variance over and over again to firmly implant into your statistical mind (we already said, but redundancy works, it’s a thing). Pro tip: Three-legged race as a metaphor for co-variance. Two people tie one leg to each other, then try to walk. It works when they co-vary their legs together (positive relationship). They can also co-vary in an unhelpful way, when one person tries to move forward exactly when the other person tries to move backward. This is still co-variance (negative relationship). Funny random walking happens when there is no co-variance. This means one person does whatever they want, and so does the other person. There is a lot of variance, but the variance is shared randomly, so it’s just a bunch of legs moving around accomplishing nothing. Pro tip #2: Succesfully playing paddycake occurs when two people coordinate their actions so they have postively shared co-variance. 3.3 Turning the numbers into a measure of co-variance “Ok, so if you are saying that co-variance is just another word for correlation or relationship between two measures, I’m good with that. I suppose we would need some way to measure that.” Correct, back to our table…notice anything new? subject chocolate happiness Chocolate_X_Happiness 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 2 2 4 4 3 4 12 5 4 4 16 6 3 6 18 7 4 4 16 8 7 7 49 9 7 6 42 10 6 7 42 Sums 39 42 202 Means 3.9 4.2 20.2 We’ve added a new column called “Chocolate_X_Happiness”, which translates to Chocolate scores multiplied by Happiness scores. Each row in the new column, is the product, or multiplication of the chocolate and happiness score for that row. Yes, but why would we do this? Last chapter we took you back to Elementary school and had you think about division. Now it’s time to do the same thing with multiplication. We assume you know how that works. One number times another, means taking the first number, and adding it as many times as the second says to do, \\(2*2= 2+2=4\\), \\(2*6= 2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12\\), or \\(6+6=12\\), same thing. Yes, you know all that. But, can you bend multiplication to your will, and make it do your bidding when need to solve a problem like summarizing co-variance? Multiplication is the droid you are looking for. We know how to multiple numbers, and all we have to next is think about the consequences of multiplying sets of numbers together. For example, what happens when you multiply two small numbers together, compared to multiplying two big numbers together? The first product should be smaller than the second product right? How about things like multiplying a small number by a big number? Those products should be in between right?. Then next step is to think about how the products of two measures sum together, depending on how they line up. Let’s look at another table: scores X Y A B XY AB 1 1 1 1 10 1 10 2 2 2 2 9 4 18 3 3 3 3 8 9 24 4 4 4 4 7 16 28 5 5 5 5 6 25 30 6 6 6 6 5 36 30 7 7 7 7 4 49 28 8 8 8 8 3 64 24 9 9 9 9 2 81 18 10 10 10 10 1 100 10 Sums 55 55 55 55 385 220 Means 5.5 5.5 5.5 5.5 38.5 22 Look at the X and Y column. The scores for X and Y perfectly co-vary. When X is 1, Y is 1; when X is 2, Y is 2, etc. They are perfectly aligned. The scores for A and B also perfectly co-vary, just in the opposite manner. When A is 1, B is 10; when A is 2, B is 9, etc. B is a reversed copy of A. Now, look at the column \\(XY\\). These are the products we get when we multiply the values of X across with the values of Y. Also, look at the column \\(AB\\). These are the products we get when we multiply the values of A across with the values of B. So far so good. Now, look at the Sums for the XY and AB columns. Not the same. The sum of the XY products is 385, and the sum of the AB products is 220. For this specific set of data, the numbers 385 and 220 are very important. They represent the biggest possible sum of products (385), and the smallest possible sum of products (220). There is no way of re-ordering the numbers 1 to 10, say for X, and the numbers 1 to 10 for Y, that would ever produce larger or smaller numbers. Don’t believe me? Check this out: The above graph shows 1000 computer simuations. I forced my computer to randomly order the numbers 1 to 10 for X, and randomly order the numbers 1 to 10 for Y. Then, I multiplied X and Y, and added the products together. I did this 1000 times. The dot’s show the sum of the products for each simluation. The two black lines show the maximum possible sum (385), and the minimum possible sum (220), for this set of numbers. Notice, how all of the dots are in between the maximum and minimum possible values. Told you so. “Ok fine, you told me so…So what, who cares?”. We’ve been looking for a way to summarize the covariance between two measures right? Well, for these numbers, we have found one, haven’t we. It’s the sum of the products. We know that when the sum of the products is 385, we have found a perfect, positive correlation. We know, that when the sum of the products is 220, we have found a perfect negative correlation. What about the numbers in between. What we could conclude about the correlation if we found the sum of the products to be 350. Well, it’s going to be positive, because it’s close to 385, and that’s perfectly positive. If the sum of the products was 240, that’s going to be negative, because it’s close to the perfectly negatively correlating 220. What about no correlation? Well, that’s going to be in the middle between 220 and 385 right. We have just come up with a data-specific summary measure for the correlation between the numbers 1 to 10 in X, and the numbers 1 to 10 in Y, it’s the sum of the products. We know the maximum (385) and minimum values (220), so we can now interpret any product sum for this kind of data with respect to that scale. Pro tip: When the correlation between two measures increases in the positive direction, the sum of their products increases to its maximum possible value. This is because the bigger numbers in X will tend to line up with the bigger numbers in Y, creating the biggest possible sum of products. When the correlation between two measures increases in the negative direction, the sum of their products decreases to its minimum possible value. This is because the bigger numbers in X will tend to line up with the smaller numbers in Y, creating the smallest possible sum of products. When there is no correlation, the big numbers in X will be randomly lined up with the big and small numbers in Y, making the sum of the products, somewhere in the middle. 3.3.1 Co-variance, the measure We took some time to see what happens when you multiply sets of numbers together. We found that \\(big*big = bigger\\) and \\(small*small=\\text{still small}\\), and \\(big*small=\\text{in the middle}\\). The purpose of this was to give you some conceptual idea of how the covariance between two measures is reflected in the sum of their products. We did something very straightforward. We just multiplied X with Y, and looked at how the product sums get big and small, as X and Y co-vary in different ways. Now, we can get a little bit more formal. In statistics, co-variance is not just the straight multiplication of values in X and Y. Instead, it’s the multiplication of the deviations in X from the mean of X, and the deviation in Y from the mean of Y. Remember those difference scores from the mean we talked about last chapter? They’re coming back to haunt you know, but in a good way like Casper the friendly ghost. Let’s see what this look like in a table: subject chocolate happiness C_d H_d Cd_x_Hd 1 1 1 -2.9 -3.2 9.28 2 2 1 -1.9 -3.2 6.08 3 2 2 -1.9 -2.2 4.18 4 3 4 -0.9 -0.2 0.18 5 4 4 0.1 -0.2 -0.02 6 3 6 -0.9 1.8 -1.62 7 4 4 0.1 -0.2 -0.02 8 7 7 3.1 2.8 8.68 9 7 6 3.1 1.8 5.58 10 6 7 2.1 2.8 5.88 Sums 39 42 0 0 38 Means 4 4 0 0 4 We have computed the deviations from the mean for the chocolate scores, and the deviations from the mean for the happiness scores. Then, we multiplied them together (last column). Finally, you can see the mean of the products listed in the bottom right corner of the table, the official the covariance. The formula for the covariance is: \\(cov(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})(y_{i}-\\bar{y})}{N}\\) Ok, so now we have a formal single number to calculate the relationship between two variables. This is great, it’s what we’ve been looking for. However, there is a problem. Remember when we learned how to compute just the plain old variance. We looked at that number, and we didn’t know what to make of it. It was squared, it wasn’t in the same scale as the original data. So, we square rooted the variance to produce the standard deviation, which gave us a more interpretable number in the range of our data. The co-variance has a similar problem. When you calculate the covariance as we just did, we don’t know immediately know its scale. Is a 3 big? is as 6 big? is a 100 big? How big or small is this thing? From our prelude discussion on the idea of co-variance, we learned the sum of products between two measures ranges between a maximum and minimum value. The same is true of the co-variance. For a given set of data, there is a maximum possible positive value for the covariance (which occurs when there is perfect positive correlation). And, there is a minimum possible negative value for the covariance (which occurs when there is a perfect negative correlation). When there is zero covariation, guess what happens. Zeroes. So, at the very least, when we look at a covariation statistic, we can see if what direction it points, positive or negative. But, we don’t know how big or small it is compared to the maxiumum or minimum possible value, so we don’t know the relative size, which means we can’t say how strong the correlation is. What to do? 3.3.2 Pearson’s r we there yet Yes, we are here now. Wouldn’t it be nice if could force our measure of covariation to be between -1 and +1. -1 would be the minimum possible value for a perfect negative correlation. +1 would be the maximum possible value for a perfect positive correlation. 0 would mean no correlation. Everything in between 0 and -1 would be increasingly large negative correlations. Everything between 0 and +1 would be increasingly large positive correlations. It would be a fantastic, sensible, easy to interpret system. If only we could force the covariation number to be between -1 and 1. Fortunately, for us, this episode is brought to you by Pearson’s r, which does precisely this wonderful thing. Let’s take a look at a formula for Pearson’s r: \\(r = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_{X}\\sigma_{Y}} = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{SD_{X}SD_{Y}}\\) We see the symbol \\(\\sigma\\) here, that’s more Greek for you. \\(\\sigma\\) is often used as a symbol for the standard deviation (SD). If we read out the formula in English, we see that r is the covariance of X and Y, divided by the product of the standard deviation of X and the standard deviation of Y. Why are we dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations. This operation has the effect of normalizing the covariance into the range -1 to 1. But, we will fill this part in as soon as we can…promisary note to explain the magic. FYI, it’s not magic. Brief explanation here is that dividing each measure by its standard deviation ensures that the values in each measure are in the same range as one another. For now, we will call this mathematical magic. It works, but we don’t have space to tell you why it works right now. It’s worth saying that there are loads of different formulas for computing Pearson’s r. You can find them by googling them. We will probably include more of them here, when we get around to it. However, they all give you the same answer. And, they are all not as pretty as each other. Some of them might even look scary. In other statistics textbook you will often find formulas that are easier to use for calculation purposes. For example, if you only had a pen and paper, you might use one or another formula because it helps you compute the answer faster than if you did by hand using the approach we took here. To be honest, we are not very interested in teaching you how to plug numbers into formulas. We give one lesson on that here: Put the numbers into the letters, then compute the answer. Sorry to be snarky. Nowadays you have a computer that you should use for this kind of stuff. So, we are more interested in teaching you what the calculations mean, rather than how to do them. Of course, every week we are showing you how to do the calculations in lab with computers, because that is important to. Does Pearson’s R really stay between -1 and 1 no matter what? It’s true, take a look at the following simulation. Here I randomly ordered the numbers 1 to 10 for an X measure, and did the same for a Y measure. Then, I computed Pearson’s r, and repeated this process 1000 times. As you can see all of the dots are between -1 and 1. Neat huh. 3.4 Examples with Data Examples here 3.5 Regression: A mini intro We’re going to spend the next little bit adding one more thing to our understanding of correlation. It’s called linear regression. It sounds scary, and it really is. You’ll find out much later in the textbook that everything we will be soon be talking about can be thought of as a special case of regression. But, we don’t want to scard you off, so right now we just introduce the basic concepts. First, let’s look at a linear regression. This way we can see what we’re trying to learn about. Here’s some scatterplots, same one’s you’ve already seen. But, we’ve added something new! Lines. 3.5.1 The best fit line Notice anything about these blue lines? Hopefully you can see, at least for the first two panels, that they go straight through the data, just like a kebab skewer. We call these lines best fit lines, because according to our definition (soon we promise) there are no other lines that you could draw that would do a better job of going straight throw the data. One big idea here is that we are using the line as a kind of mean to describe the relationship between the two variables. When we only have one variable, that variable exists on a single dimension, it’s 1D. So, it is appropriate that we only have one number, like the mean, to describe it’s central tendency. When we have two variables, and plot them together, we now have a two-dimensional space. So, for two dimensions we could use a bigger thing that is 2d, like a line, to summarize the central tendency of the relationship between the two variables. What do we want out of our line? Well, if you had a pencil, and a printout of the data, you could draw all sorts of straight lines any way you wanted. Your lines wouldn’t even have to go through the data, or they could slant through the data with all sorts of angles. Would all of those lines be very good a describing the general pattern of the dots? Most of them would not. The best lines would go through the data following the general shape of the dots. Of the best lines, however, which one is the best? How can we find out, and what do we mean by that? In short, the best fit line is the one that has the least error. R code for plotting residuals thanks to Simon Jackson’s blog post: https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/visualising-residuals Check out this next plot, it shows a line through some dots. But, it also shows some teeny tiny lines. These lines drop down from each dot, and they land on the line. Each of these little lines is called a residual. They show you how far off the line is for diferent dots. It’s measure of error, it shows us just how wrong the line is. After all, it’s pretty obvious that not all of the dots are on the line. This means the line does not actually represent all of the dots. The line is wrong. But, the best fit line is the least wrong of all the wrong lines. There’s a lot going on in this graph. First, we are looking at a scatter plot of two variables, an X and Y variable. Each of the black dots are the actual values from these variables. You can see there is a negative correlation here, as X increases, Y tends to decrease. We drew a regression line through the data, that’s the blue line. There’s these little white dots too. This is where the line thinks the black dots should be. The red lines are the important residuals we’ve been talking about. Each black dot has a red line that drops straight down, or straight up fromt he location of the black dot, and lands directly on the line. We can already see that many of the dots are not on the line, so we already know the line is “off” about those dots. The red line just makes it easier to see exactly how off the line is. The important thing that is happening here, is that the the blue line is drawn is such a way, that it minimizes the length of the red lines. For example, if we wanted to know how wrong this line was, we could simply gather up all the red lines the residuals), measure how long they are, and then add all the wrongness together. This would give us the total amount of wrongness. We usually call this the error. In fact, we’ve already talked about this idea before when we discussed standard deviation. What we will actually be doing with the red lines, is computing the sum of the squared deviations from the line. That sum is the total amount of error. Now, this blue line here minimizes the sum of the squared deviations. Everything other line would produce a larger total error. Here’s a few more graphs to see this in action. First, imagine we drew a different line, up higher in the graph. We coul still compute the red line residuals, and then add up the error, and see how big it was. If we go way up, the red lines will get longer and longer, so the total error will get bigger and bigger. As we move away from the sweet spot going up, the error gets bigger. The same thing will happen if we move the line down, the error will get bigger and bigger. Here’s what that looks like: ## (Intercept) ## 30.09886 ## hp ## -0.06822828 Both of these new black lines are even worse at describing the pattern of dots. First of all they are taller and shorter than all of the dots. I wouldn’t want to use either of these lines to summarize where most of the dots were. When we move the line up and down, the red lines also get longer and longer, so the error gets bigger and bigger. Regression lines are like Goldilocks, they’re just right, and they’re in the middle. This next graph shows a little simulation of how the sum of squared deviations (the sum of the squared lengths of the red lines) behaves as we move the line up and down. Ok, so we haven’t talked about the y-intercept yet. But, what this graph shows is how the total error behaves as we move the line up and down. The y-intercept here is the thing we change that makes our line move up and down. As you can see the dots go up when we move the line down from 0 to -5, and the dots go up when we move the line up from 0 to +5. The best line, that minimizes the error occurs right in the middle, when we don’t move the blue regression line at all. 3.5.2 Lines Ok, fine you say. So, there is one magic line that will go through the middle of the scatterplot and minimize the sum of the squared deviations. How do I find this magic line? We’ll show you. But, to be completely honest, you’ll almost never do it the way we’ll show you here. Instead, it’s much easier to use software and make your computer do it for. You’ll learn how to that in the labs. Before we show you how to find the regression line, it’s worth refreshing your memory about how lines work, especially in 2 dimensions. Remember this? \\(y = ax + b\\), or also \\(y = mx + b\\) (sometimes a or m is used for the slope) This is the formula for a line. Another way of writing it is: \\(y = slope * x + \\text{y-intercept}\\) The slope is the slant of the line, and the y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis. Let’s look at some lines: So there is two lines. The formula for the blue line is \\(y = 1*x + 5\\). Let’s talk about that. When x = 0, where is the blue line on the y-axis? It’s at five. That happens because 1 times 0 is 0, and then we just have the five left over. When x = 5, y =10. You just need the plug in the numbers to the formula, like this: \\(y = 1*x + 5\\) \\(y = 1*5 + 5 = 5+5 =10\\) The point of the formula is to tell you where y will be, for any number of x. The slope of the line tells you whether the line is going to go up or down, as you move from the left to the right. The blue line has a positive slope of one, so it goes up as x goes up. How much does it go up? It goes up by one for everyone one of x! If we made the slope a 2, it would be much steeper, and go up faster. The red line has a negative slope, so it slants down. This means \\(y\\) goes down, as \\(x\\) goes up. When there is no slant, and we want to make a perfectly flat line, we set the slope to 0. This means that y doesn’t go anywhere as x gets bigger and smaller. That’s lines. 3.5.3 Computing the best fit line If you have a scatterplot showing the locations of scores from two variables, the real question is how can you find the slope and the y-intercept for the best fit line? What are you going to do? Draw millions of lines, add up the residuals, and then see which one was best? That would take forever. Fortunately, there are computers, and when you don’t have one around, there’s also some handy formulas. It’s worth pointing out just how much computers have changed everything. Before computers everyone had to do these calculations by hand, such a chore! Aside from the deeper mathematical ideas in the formulas, many of them were made for convenience, to speed up hand calculations, because there were no computers. Now that we have computers, the hand calculations are often just an exercise in algebra. Perhaps they build character. You decide. We’ll show you the formulas. And, work through one example by hand. It’s the worst, we know. By the way, you should feel sorry for me as I do this entire thing by hand for you. Here are two formulas we can use to calculate the slope and the intercept, straight from the data. We won’t go into why these formulas do what they do. These ones are for “easy” calculation. \\(slope = a = \\frac{\\sum{y}\\sum{x^2}-\\sum{x}\\sum{xy}}{n\\sum{x^2}-(\\sum{x})^2}\\) \\(intercept = b = \\frac{n\\sum{xy}-\\sum{x}\\sum{y}}{n\\sum{x^2}-(\\sum{x})^2}\\) In these formulas, the \\(x\\) and the \\(y\\) refer to the individual scores. Here’s a table showing you how everything fits together. scores x y x_squared y_squared xy 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 5 16 25 20 3 3 1 9 1 3 4 6 8 36 64 48 5 5 6 25 36 30 6 7 8 49 64 56 7 8 9 64 81 72 Sums 34 39 200 275 231 We see 7 sets of scores for the x and y variable. We calculated \\(x^2\\) by squaring each value of x, and putting it in a column. We calculated \\(y^2\\) by squareing each value of y, and putting it in a column. Then we calculated \\(xy\\), by multiplying each \\(x\\) score with each \\(y\\) score, and put that in a column. Then we added all the columns up, and put the sums at the bottom. These are all the number we need for the formulas to find the best fit line. Here’s what the formulas look like when we put numbers in them: $slope = a = = = -1.23 $ \\(intercept = b = \\frac{n\\sum{xy}-\\sum{x}\\sum{y}}{n\\sum{x^2}-(\\sum{x})^2} = \\frac{6*231-34*39}{6*275-34^2} = 1.36\\) Great, now we can check our work, let’s plot the scores in a scatterplot and draw a line through it with slope = -1.23, and a y-intercept of 1.36. It should go through the middle of the dots. ## (Intercept) y ## 0.8440594 0.7202970 3.6 Interpreting Correlations What does the presence or the absence of a correlation between two measures mean? How should correlations be interpreted? What kind of inferences can be drawn from correlations? These are all very good questions. A first piece of advice is to use caution when interpreting correlations. Here’s why. 3.6.1 Correlation does not equal causation Perhaps you have heard that correlation does not equal causation. Why not? There are lots of reasons why not. However, before listing some of the reasons let’s start with a case where we would expect a causal connection between two measurements. Consider, buying a snake plant for your home. Snake plants are supposed to be easy to take care of because you can mostly ignore them. Like most plants, snake plants need some water to stay alive. However, they also need just the right amount of water. Imagine an experiment where 1000 snake plants were grown in a house. Each snake plant is given a different amount of water per day, from zero teaspoons of water per day to 1000 teaspoons of water per day. We will assume that water is part of the causal process that allows snake plants to grow. The amount of water given to each snake plant per day can also be one of our measures. Imagine further that every week the experimenter measures snake plant growth, which will be the second measurement. Now, can you imagine for yourself what a scatter plot of weekly snake plant growth by tablespoons of water would look like? 3.6.1.1 Even when there is causation, there might not be obvious correlation The first plant given no water at all would have a very hard time and eventually die. It should have the least amount of weekly growth. How about the plants given only a few teaspoons of water per day. This could be just enough water to keep the plants alive, so they will grow a little bit but not alot. If you are imagining a scatterplot, with each dot being a snake plant, then you should imagine some dots starting in the bottom left hand corner (no water &amp; no plant growth), moving up and to the right (a bit of water, and a bit of growth). As we look at snake plants getting more and more water, we should see more and more plant growth, right? “Sure, but only up to a point”. Correct, there should be a trend for a positive correlation with increasing plant growth as amount of water per day increases. But, what happens when you give snake plants too much water? From personal experience, they die. So, at some point, the dots in the scatter plot will start moving back down again. Snake plants that get way too much water will not grow very well. The imaginary scatterplot you should be envisioning could have an upside U shape. Going from left to right, the dot’s go up, they reach a maximum, then they go down again reaching a minimum. Computing Pearson’s r for data like this can give you \\(r\\) values close to zero. There are many ways to create a summary statistic for relationships between variables that are like Pearson’s r. We discuss some of these in the chapter on Linear Regression. This example illustrates some conundrums in interpreting correlations. We already know that water is needed for plants to grow, so we are rightly expecting there to be a relationship between measure of amount of water and plant growth. If we look at the first half of the data we see a positive correlation, if we look at the last half of the data we see a negative correlation, and if we look at all of the data we see no correlation. Yikes. So, even when there is a causal connection between two measures, we won’t necessarilly clear evidence of the connection just by computing a correlation coefficient. Pro Tip: This is one reason why plotting your data is so important. If you see an upside U shape pattern, then a correlation analysis is probably not the best analysis for your data. 3.6.1.2 Confounding variable, or Third variable problem Anybody can correlate any two things that can be quantified and measured. For example, we could find a hundred people, ask them all sorts of questions like: how happy are you how old are you how tall are you how much money do you make per year how long are your eyelashes how many books have you read in your life how loud is your inner voice Let’s say we found a positive correlation between yearly salary and happiness. Note, we could have just as easily computed the same correlation between happiness and yearly salary. If we found a correlation, would you be willing to infer that yearly salary causes happiness? Perhaps it does play a small part. But, something like happiness probably has a lot of contributing causes. Money could directly cause some people to be happy. But, more likely, money buys people access to all sorts of things, and some of those things might contribute happiness. Theses “other” things are called third variables. For example, perhaps people living in nicer places in more expensive houses are more happy than people in worse places in cheaper houses. In this scenario, money isn’t causing happiness, it’s the places and houses that money buys. But, even is this were true, people can still be more or less in lots of different situations. The lesson here is that a correlation can occur between two measures because of a third variable that is not directly measured. So, just because we find a correlation, does not mean we can conlude anything about a causal connection between two measurements. 3.6.2 Correlation and Random chance Another very important aspect of correlations is the fact that they can be produced by random chance. This means that you can find a positive or negative correlation between two measures, even when they have absolutely nothing to do with one another. You might have hoped to find zero correlation when two measures are totally unrelated to each other. Althought this certainly happens, unrelated measures can accidentally produce spurious correlations, just by chance alone. Let’s demonstrate how correlations can occur by chance when there is no causal connection between two measures. Imagine two participants. One is at the North pole with a lottery machine full of balls with numbers from 1 to 10. The other is at the south pole with a different lottery machine full of balls with numbers from 1 to 10. There are an endless supply of balls in the machine, so every number could be picked for any ball. Each participant randomly chooses 10 balls, then records the number on the ball. In this situation we will assume that there is no possible way that balls chosen by the first participant could causally influence the balls chose by the second participant. They are on the other side of the world. We should assume that the balls will be chosen by chance alone. Here is what the numbers on each ball could look like for each participant: Ball North_pole South_pole 1 6 5 2 3 10 3 4 2 4 4 7 5 5 5 6 2 7 7 9 5 8 4 10 9 5 2 10 6 4 In this one case, if we computed Pearons’ \\(r\\), we would find that \\(r =\\) -0.3982161. But, we already know that this value does not tell us anything about the relationship between the balls chosen in the north and sout pole. We know that relationship should be completely random, because that is how we set up the game. The better question here is to ask what can random chance do? For example, if we ran our game over and over again thousands of times, each time choosing new balls, and each time computing the correlation, what would we find?First, we will find fluctuation. The r value will sometimes be positive, sometimes be negative, sometimes be big and sometimes be small. Second, we will see what the fluctuation looks like. This will give us a window into the kinds of correlations that chance alone can produce. Let’s see what happens. 3.6.2.1 Monte-carlo simulation of random correlations It is possible to use a computer to simulate our game as many times as we want. This process is often termed monte-carlo simulation. Below is a script written for the programming language R. We won’t go into the details of the code here. However, let’s briefly explain what is going on. Notice, the part that says for(sim in 1:1000). This creates a loop that repeats our game 1000 times. Inside the loop there are variables named North_pole and South_pole. During each simulation, we sample 10 random numbers (between 1 to 10) into each variable. These random numbers stand for the numbers that would have been on the balls from the lottery machine. Once we have 10 random numbers for each, we then compute the correlation using cor(North_pole,South_pole). Then, we save the correlation value and move on to the next simulation. At the end, we will have 1000 individual Pearson \\(r\\) values. simulated_correlations &lt;- length(0) for(sim in 1:1000){ North_pole &lt;- runif(10,1,10) South_pole &lt;- runif(10,1,10) simulated_correlations[sim] &lt;- cor(North_pole,South_pole) } sim_df &lt;- data.frame(sims=1:1000,simulated_correlations) ggplot(sim_df, aes(x = sims, y = simulated_correlations))+ geom_point()+ theme_classic()+ geom_hline(yintercept = -1)+ geom_hline(yintercept = 1)+ ggtitle(&quot;Simulation of 1000 r values&quot;) Let’s take a look at all of the 1000 Pearson \\(r\\) values. Does the figure below look familiar to you? It should, we have already conducted a similar kind of simulation before. Each dot in the scatterplot shows the Pearson \\(r\\) for each simulation from 1 to 1000. As you can see the dots are all of the place, in between the range -1 to 1. The important lesson here is that random chance produced all of these correlations. This means we can find “correlations” in the data that are completely meaningless, and do not reflect any causal relationship between one measure and another. Let’s illustrate the idea of finding “random” correlations one more time, with a little movie. This time, we will show you a scatterplot of the random values sampled for the balls chosen from the North and South pole. If there is no relationship we should see dots going everywhere. If there happens to be a positive relationship (purely by chance), we should see the dots going from the bottom left to the top right. If there happens to be a negative relationship (purely by chance), we should see the dots going from the top left down to the bottom right. On more thing to prepare you for the movie. There are three scatterplots below, showing negative, positive, and zero correlations between two variabls. You’ve already seen this graph before. But, we added something. Blue lines. “Oooh blue lines, tell me more”. The are helpful for seeing the correlation. We are drawing the lines straight through the dots (we’ll learn more about in the chapter on linear regression), such that they do the best job of summarizing the middle of dots. Negative correlations occur when a line goes down from the top left to bottom right. Positive correlations occur when a line goes up from the bottom left to the top right. Zero correlations occur when the line is flat (doesn’t go up or down). Ok, now we are ready for the movie. You are looking at the process of sampling two set of numbers randomly, one for the X variable, and one for the Y variable. Each time we sample 10 numbers for each, plot them, then draw a line through them. Remember, these numbers are all completely random, so we should expect, on average that there should be no correlation between the numbers. However, this is not what happens. You can the line going all over the place. Sometimes we find a negative correlation (line goes down), sometimes we see a positive correlation (line goes up), and sometimes it looks like zero correlation (line is more flat). You might be thinking this is kind of disturbing. If we know that there should be no correlation between two random variables, how come we are finding correlations? This is a big problem right? I mean, if someone showed me a correlation between two things, and then claimed one thing was related to another, how could know if it was true. After all, it could be chance! Chance can do that too. Fortunately, all is not lost. We can look at our simulated data in another way, using a histogram. Remember, just before the movie, we simulated 1000 different correlations using random numbers. By, putting all of those \\(r\\) values into a histogram, we can get a better sense of how chance behaves. We can see what kind of correlations chance is likely or unlikely to produce. Here is a histogram of the simulated \\(r\\) values. Notic that this histogram is not flat. Most of the simulated \\(r\\) values are close to zero. Notice, also that the bars get smaller as you move away from zero in the positive or negative direction. The general take home here is that chance can produce a wide range of correlations. However, not all correlations happen very often. For example, the bars for -1 and 1 are very small. Chance does not produce nearly perfect correlations very often. The bars around -.5 and .5 are smaller than the bars around zero, as medium correlations do not occur as often as small correlations by chance alone. You can think of this histogram as the window of chance. It shows what chance often does, and what it often does not do. If you found a correlation under these very same circumstances (e.g., measured the correlation between two sets of 10 random numbers), then you could consult this window. What should you ask the window? How about, could my observed correlation (the one that you found in your data) have come from this window. Let’s say you found a correlation of \\(r = .1\\). Could a .1 have come from the histogram? Well, look at the histogram around where the .1 mark on the x-axis is. Is there a big bar there? If so, this means that chance produces this value fairly often. You might be comfortable with the inference, Yes, this .1 could have been produced by chance, because it is well inside the window of chance. How about \\(r = .5\\)? The bar is much smaller here, you might think, “well, I can see that chance does produce .5 some times, so chance could have produced my .5. Did it? Maybe, maybe not, not sure”. Here, your confidence in a strong inference might start getting a bit shakier. How about an \\(r = .95\\)?. You might see that the bar for .95 is very very small, perhaps too small to see. What does this tell you? It tells you that chance does not produce .95 very often, hardly if at all, pretty much never. So, if you found a .95 in your data, what would infer? Perhaps you would be comfortable inferring that chance did not produce your .95, after .95 is not inside the window of chance. In this section we have started to build some intuitions about inferential statistics. We go into more detail in the next chapters. For now, the main ideas are: We can measure relationships in data using things like correlation The correlations we measure can be produced by numerous things, so they are hard to to intrepret Correlations can be produced by chance, so have the potential to be completely meaningless. However, we can create a model of exactly what chance can do. The model tells us whether chance is more or less likely to produce correlations of different sizes We can use the chance model to help us make decisions about our own data. We can compare the correlation we found in our data to the model, then ask whether or not chance could have or was likely to have produced our results. 3.6.2.2 Increasing sample-size decreases opportunity for spurious correlation Before moving on, let’s do one more thing with correlations. In our pretend lottery game, each participant only sampled 10 balls each. We found that this could lead to a range of correlations between the number randomly drawn from either sides of the pole. Indeed, we even found some correlations that were medium to large in size. If you were a researcher who found such correlations, you might be tempted to believe there was a relationship between your measurements. However, we know in our little game, that those correlations would be spurious, just a product of random sampling. The good news is that, as a researcher, you get to make the rules of the game. You get to determine how chance can play. This is all a little bit metaphorical, so let’s make it concrete. We will see what happens in four different scenarios. First, we will repeat what we already did. Each participant will draw 10 balls, then we compute the correlation, and do this over 1000 times and look at a histrogram. Second, we will change the game so each participant draws 50 balls each, and then repeat our simulation. Third, and fourth, we will change the game so each participant draws 100 balls each, and then 1000 balls each, and repeat etc. The graph below shows four different histograms of the Pearson \\(r\\) values in each of the different scenarios. Each scenario involves a different sample-size, from, 10, 50, 100 to 1000. By inspecting the four histrograms you should notice a clear pattern. The width or range of each histogram shrinks as the sample-size increases. What is going on here? Well, we already know that we can think of these histograms as windows of chance. They tell us which \\(r\\) values occur fairly often, which do not. When our sample-size is 10, lots of different \\(r\\) values happen. That histrogram is very flat and spread out. However, as the sample-size inreases, we see that the window of chance gets pulled in. For example, by the time we get to 1000 balls each, almost all of the Pearson \\(r\\) values are very close to 0. One take home here, is that increasing sample-size narrows the window of chance. So, for example, if you ran a study involving 1000 samples of two measures, and you found a correlation of .5, then you can clearly see in the bottom right histogram that .5 does not occur very often by chance alone. In fact, there is no bar, because it didnt happen even once in the simulation. As a result, when you have a large sample size like n = 1000, you might be more confident that your observed correlation (say of .5) was not a spurious correlation. If chance is not producing your result, then something else is. Finally, notice how your confidence about whether or not chance is mucking about with your results depends on your sample size. If you only obtained 10 samples per measurement, and found \\(r = .5\\), you should not be as confident that your correlation reflects a real relationship. Instead, you can see that \\(r\\)’s of .5 happen fairly often by chance alone. Pro tip: when you run an experiment you get to decide how many samples you will collect, which means you can choose to narrow the window of chance. Then, if you find a relationship in the data you can be more confident that your finding is real, and not just something that happened by chance. 3.6.3 Some more movies Let’s ingrain these idea with some more movies. When our sample-size is small (N is small), sampling error can cause all sort “patterns” in the data. This makes it possible, and indeed common, for “correlations” to occur between two sets of numbers. When we increase the sample-size, sampling error is reduced, making it less possible for “correlations” to occur just by chance alone. When is large, chance has less of an opportunity to operate. 3.6.3.1 Watching how correlation behaves when there is no correlation Below we randomly sample numbers for two variables, plot them, and show the correlation using a line. There are four panels, each showing the number of observations in the samples, from 10, 50, 100, to 1000 in each sample. Remember, because we are randomly sampling numbers, there should be no relationship between the X and Y variables. But, as we have been discussing, because of chance, we can sometimes observe a correlation (due to chance). The important thing to watch is how the line behaves across the four panels. The line twirls around in all directions when the sample size is 10. It is also moves around quite a bit when the sample size is 50 or 100. It still moves a bit when the sample size is 1000, but much less. In all cases we expect that the line should be flat, but every time we take new samples, sometimes the line shows us pseudo patterns. Which line should you trust? Well, hopefully you can see that the line for 1000 samples is the most stable. It tends to be very flat every time, and it does not depend so much on the particular sample. The line with 10 observations per sample goes all over the place. The take home here, is that if someone told you that they found a correlation, you should want to know how many observations they hand in their sample. If they only had 10 observations, how could you trust the claim that there was a correlation? You can’t!!! Not now that you know samples that are that small can do all sorts of things by chance alone. If instead, you found out the sample was very large, then you might trust that finding a little bit more. For example, in the above movie you can see that when there are 1000 samples, we never see a strong or weak correlation; the line is always flat. This is because chance almost never produces strong correlations when the sample size is very large. In the above example, we sampled numbers random numbers from a uniform distribution. Many examples of real-world data will come from a normal or approximately normal distibribution. We can repeat the above, but sample random numbers from the same normal distribution. There will still be zero actual correlation between the X and Y variables, because everything is sampled randomly. But, we still see the same behavior as above. The computed correlation for small sample-sizes flucuate wildly, and large sample sizes do not. Ok, so what do things look like when there actually is a correlation between variables? 3.6.3.2 Watching correlations behave when there really is a correlation Sometimes there really are correlations between two variables that are not caused by chance. Below, we get to watch a movie of four scatterplots. Each shows the correlation between two variables. Again, we change the sample-size in steps of 10, 50 100, and 1000. The data have programmed to contain a real positive correlation. So, we should expect that the line will be going up from the bottom left to the top right. However, there is still variability in the data. So this time, sampling error due to chance will fuzz the correlation. We know it is there, but sometimes chance will cause the correlation to be eliminated. Notice that in the top left panel (sample-size 10), the line is twirling around much more than the other panels. Every new set of samples produces different correlations. Sometimes, the line even goes flat or downward. However, as we increase sample-size, we can see that the line doesn’t change very much, it is always going up showing a positive correlation. The main takeaway here is that even when there is a positive correlation between two things, you might not be able to see it if your sample size is small. For example, you might get unlucky with the one sample that you measured. Your sample could show a negative correlation, even when the actual correlation is positive! Unfortunately, in the real world we usually only have the sample that we collected, so we always have to wonder if we got lucky or unlucky. Fortunately, if you want to remove luck, all you need to do is collect larger samples. Then you will be much more likely to observe the real pattern, rather the pattern that can be introduced by chance. "],

Forde Sections 5.1 &amp; 5.2 - Original text by Danielle Navarro Section 5.3 - Matthew Crump Section 5.4 - Mix of Crump &amp; Navarro Remember, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise what we do know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to “learn what we do not know from what we do”. What kinds of things would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them? These are the questions that lie at the heart of inferential statistics, and they are traditionally divided into two “big ideas”: estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal in this chapter is to introduce the first of these big ideas, estimation theory, but we’ll talk about sampling theory first because estimation theory doesn’t make sense until you understand sampling. So, this chapter divides into sampling theory, and how to make use of sampling theory to discuss how statisticians think about estimation. We have already done lots of sampling, so you are already familiar with some of the big ideas. 4.1 Samples, populations and sampling Sampling theory plays a huge role in specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely. And in order to talk about “making inferences” the way statisticians think about it, we need to be a bit more explicit about what it is that we’re drawing inferences from (the sample) and what it is that we’re drawing inferences about (the population). In almost every situation of interest, what we have available to us as researchers is a sample of data. We might have run experiment with some number of participants; a polling company might have phoned some number of people to ask questions about voting intentions; etc. Regardless: the data set available to us is finite, and incomplete. We can’t possibly get every person in the world to do our experiment; a polling company doesn’t have the time or the money to ring up every voter in the country etc. In our earlier discussion of descriptive statistics, this sample was the only thing we were interested in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, summarising and graphing that sample. This is about to change. 4.1.1 Defining a population A sample is a concrete thing. You can open up a data file, and there’s the data from your sample. A population, on the other hand, is a more abstract idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible observations, that you want to draw conclusions about, and is generally much bigger than the sample. In an ideal world, the researcher would begin the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is, since the process of designing a study and testing hypotheses about the data that it produces does depend on the population about which you want to make statements. However, that doesn’t always happen in practice: usually the researcher has a fairly vague idea of what the population is and designs the study as best he/she can on that basis. Sometimes it’s easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in the “polling company” example, the population consisted of all voters enrolled at the a time of the study – millions of people. The sample was a set of 1000 people who all belong to that population. In most situations the situation is much less simple. In a typical a psychological experiment, determining the population of interest is a bit more complicated. Suppose I run an experiment using 100 undergraduate students as my participants. My goal, as a cognitive scientist, is to try to learn something about how the mind works. So, which of the following would count as “the population”: All of the undergraduate psychology students at the University of Adelaide? Undergraduate psychology students in general, anywhere in the world? Australians currently living? Australians of similar ages to my sample? Anyone currently alive? Any human being, past, present or future? Any biological organism with a sufficient degree of intelligence operating in a terrestrial environment? Any intelligent being? Each of these defines a real group of mind-possessing entities, all of which might be of interest to me as a cognitive scientist, and it’s not at all clear which one ought to be the true population of interest. 4.1.2 Simple random samples Irrespective of how we define the population, the critical point is that the sample is a subset of the population, and our goal is to use our knowledge of the sample to draw inferences about the properties of the population. The relationship between the two depends on the procedure by which the sample was selected. This procedure is referred to as a sampling method, and it is important to understand why it matters. To keep things simple, imagine we have a bag containing 10 chips. Each chip has a unique letter printed on it, so we can distinguish between the 10 chips. The chips come in two colors, black and white. Figure 4.1: Simple random sampling without replacement from a finite population This set of chips is the population of interest, and it is depicted graphically on the left of Figure 4.1. As you can see from looking at the picture, there are 4 black chips and 6 white chips, but of course in real life we wouldn’t know that unless we looked in the bag. Now imagine you run the following “experiment”: you shake up the bag, close your eyes, and pull out 4 chips without putting any of them back into the bag. First out comes the \\(a\\) chip (black), then the \\(c\\) chip (white), then \\(j\\) (white) and then finally \\(b\\) (black). If you wanted, you could then put all the chips back in the bag and repeat the experiment, as depicted on the right hand side of Figure4.1. Each time you get different results, but the procedure is identical in each case. The fact that the same procedure can lead to different results each time, we refer to it as a random process. However, because we shook the bag before pulling any chips out, it seems reasonable to think that every chip has the same chance of being selected. A procedure in which every member of the population has the same chance of being selected is called a simple random sample. The fact that we did not put the chips back in the bag after pulling them out means that you can’t observe the same thing twice, and in such cases the observations are said to have been sampled without replacement. To help make sure you understand the importance of the sampling procedure, consider an alternative way in which the experiment could have been run. Suppose that my 5-year old son had opened the bag, and decided to pull out four black chips without putting any of them back in the bag. This biased sampling scheme is depicted in Figure 4.2. Figure 4.2: Biased sampling without replacement from a finite population Now consider the evidentiary value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips. Clearly, it depends on the sampling scheme, does it not? If you know that the sampling scheme is biased to select only black chips, then a sample that consists of only black chips doesn’t tell you very much about the population! For this reason, statisticians really like it when a data set can be considered a simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis much easier. A third procedure is worth mentioning. This time around we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. This time, however, we record the observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random samples, but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after drawing them it is referred to as a sample with replacement. The difference between this situation and the first one is that it is possible to observe the same population member multiple times, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Simple random sampling with replacement from a finite population Most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without replacement, because the same person is not allowed to participate in the experiment twice. However, most statistical theory is based on the assumption that the data arise from a simple random sample with replacement. In real life, this very rarely matters. If the population of interest is large (e.g., has more than 10 entities!) the difference between sampling with- and without- replacement is too small to be concerned with. The difference between simple random samples and biased samples, on the other hand, is not such an easy thing to dismiss. 4.1.3 Most samples are not simple random samples As you can see from looking at the list of possible populations that I showed above, it is almost impossible to obtain a simple random sample from most populations of interest. When I run experiments, I’d consider it a minor miracle if my participants turned out to be a random sampling of the undergraduate psychology students at Adelaide university, even though this is by far the narrowest population that I might want to generalise to. A thorough discussion of other types of sampling schemes is beyond the scope of this book, but to give you a sense of what’s out there I’ll list a few of the more important ones: Stratified sampling. Suppose your population is (or can be) divided into several different subpopulations, or strata. Perhaps you’re running a study at several different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample randomly from the population as a whole, you instead try to collect a separate random sample from each of the strata. Stratified sampling is sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the population is already divided into the distinct strata. It can also be more efficient that simple random sampling, especially when some of the subpopulations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia it would be much better to divide the population into two strata (schizophrenic and not-schizophrenic), and then sample an equal number of people from each group. If you selected people randomly, you would get so few schizophrenic people in the sample that your study would be useless. This specific kind of of stratified sampling is referred to as oversampling because it makes a deliberate attempt to over-represent rare groups. Snowball sampling is a technique that is especially useful when sampling from a “hidden” or hard to access population, and is especially common in social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey, the participants are asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to participate. In stage 2, those new contacts are surveyed. The process continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The big advantage to snowball sampling is that it gets you data in situations that might otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random, and non-random in ways that are difficult to address. On the real life side, the disadvantage is that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well, because hidden populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an example here to highlight this: if you weren’t careful you might end up outing people who don’t want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even if you don’t make that mistake it can still be intrusive to use people’s social networks to study them. It’s certainly very hard to get people’s informed consent before contacting them, yet in many cases the simple act of contacting them and saying “hey we want to study you” can be hurtful. Social networks are complex things, and just because you can use them to get data doesn’t always mean you should. Convenience sampling is more or less what it sounds like. The samples are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected at random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These samples are generally non-random in two respects: firstly, reliance on undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are restricted to a single subpopulation. Secondly, the students usually get to pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self selected subset of psychology students not a randomly selected subset. In real life, most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is sometimes a severe limitation, but not always. 4.1.4 How much does it matter if you don’t have a simple random sample? Okay, so real world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that it can matter if your data are not a simple random sample: just think about the difference between Figures4.1 and 4.2. However, it’s not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples are entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling technique you actually know what the bias is because you created it deliberately, often to increase the effectiveness of your study, and there are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases you’ve introduced (not covered in this book!). So in those situations it’s not a problem. More generally though, it’s important to remember that random sampling is a means to an end, not the end in itself. Let’s assume you’ve relied on a convenience sample, and as such you can assume it’s biased. A bias in your sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, I’d argue that we don’t need the sample to be randomly generated in every respect: we only need it to be random with respect to the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of interest. Suppose I’m doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In study 1, I actually have the ability to sample randomly from all human beings currently alive, with one exception: I can only sample people born on a Monday. In study 2, I am able to sample randomly from the Australian population. I want to generalise my results to the population of all living humans. Which study is better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? Because we have no reason to think that being “born on a Monday” has any interesting relationship to working memory capacity. In contrast, I can think of several reasons why “being Australian” might matter. Australia is a wealthy, industrialised country with a very well-developed education system. People growing up in that system will have had life experiences much more similar to the experiences of the people who designed the tests for working memory capacity. This shared experience might easily translate into similar beliefs about how to “take a test”, a shared assumption about how psychological experimentation works, and so on. These things might actually matter. For instance, “test taking” style might have taught the Australian participants how to direct their attention exclusively on fairly abstract test materials relative to people that haven’t grown up in a similar environment; leading to a misleading picture of what working memory capacity is. There are two points hidden in this discussion. Firstly, when designing your own studies, it’s important to think about what population you care about, and try hard to sample in a way that is appropriate to that population. In practice, you’re usually forced to put up with a “sample of convenience” (e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because that’s the least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers aren’t exactly overflowing with gold), but if so you should at least spend some time thinking about what the dangers of this practice might be. Secondly, if you’re going to criticise someone else’s study because they’ve used a sample of convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from the entire human population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific theory as to how this might have distorted the results. Remember, everyone in science is aware of this issue, and does what they can to alleviate it. Merely pointing out that “the study only included people from group BLAH” is entirely unhelpful, and borders on being insulting to the researchers, who are aware of the issue. They just don’t happen to be in possession of the infinite supply of time and money required to construct the perfect sample. In short, if you want to offer a responsible critique of the sampling process, then be helpful. Rehashing the blindingly obvious truisms that I’ve been rambling on about in this section isn’t helpful. 4.1.5 Population parameters and sample statistics Okay. Setting aside the thorny methodological issues associated with obtaining a random sample, let’s consider a slightly different issue. Up to this point we have been talking about populations the way a scientist might. To a psychologist, a population might be a group of people. To an ecologist, a population might be a group of bears. In most cases the populations that scientists care about are concrete things that actually exist in the real world. Statisticians, however, are a funny lot. On the one hand, they are interested in real world data and real science in the same way that scientists are. On the other hand, they also operate in the realm of pure abstraction in the way that mathematicians do. As a consequence, statistical theory tends to be a bit abstract in how a population is defined. In much the same way that psychological researchers operationalise our abstract theoretical ideas in terms of concrete measurements, statisticians operationalise the concept of a “population” in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work with. You’ve already come across these objects they’re called probability distributions (remember, the place where data comes from). The idea is quite simple. Let’s say we’re talking about IQ scores. To a psychologist, the population of interest is a group of actual humans who have IQ scores. A statistician “simplifies” this by operationally defining the population as the probability distribution depicted in Figure 4.4a. . Figure 4.4: The population distribution of IQ scores (panel a) and two samples drawn randomly from it. In panel b we have a sample of 100 observations, and panel c we have a sample of 10,000 observations. IQ tests are designed so that the average IQ is 100, the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15, and the distribution of IQ scores is normal. These values are referred to as the population parameters because they are characteristics of the entire population. That is, we say that the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is 100, and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is 15. Now suppose we collect some data. We select 100 people at random and administer an IQ test, giving a simple random sample from the population. The sample would consist of a collection of numbers like this: 106 101 98 80 74 ... 107 72 100 Each of these IQ scores is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. So if I plot a histogram of the sample, I get something like the one shown in Figure 4.4b. As you can see, the histogram is roughly the right shape, but it’s a very crude approximation to the true population distribution shown in Figure 4.4a. The mean of the sample is fairly close to the population mean 100 but not identical. In this case, it turns out that the people in the sample have a mean IQ of 98.5, and the standard deviation of their IQ scores is 15.9. These sample statistics are properties of the data set, and although they are fairly similar to the true population values, they are not the same. In general, sample statistics are the things you can calculate from your data set, and the population parameters are the things you want to learn about. Later on in this chapter we’ll talk about how you can estimate population parameters using your sample statistics and how to work out how confident you are in your estimates but before we get to that there’s a few more ideas in sampling theory that you need to know about. 4.2 The law of large numbers We just looked at the results of one fictitious IQ experiment with a sample size of \\(N=100\\). The results were somewhat encouraging: the true population mean is 100, and the sample mean of 98.5 is a pretty reasonable approximation to it. In many scientific studies that level of precision is perfectly acceptable, but in other situations you need to be a lot more precise. If we want our sample statistics to be much closer to the population parameters, what can we do about it? The obvious answer is to collect more data. Suppose that we ran a much larger experiment, this time measuring the IQs of 10,000 people. We can simulate the results of this experiment using R, using the rnorm() function, which generates random numbers sampled from a normal distribution. For an experiment with a sample size of n = 10000, and a population with mean = 100 and sd = 15, R produces our fake IQ data using these commands: IQ &lt;- rnorm(n=10000, mean=100, sd=15) #generate IQ scores IQ &lt;- round(IQ) # make round numbers Cool, we just generated 10,000 fake IQ scores. Where did they go? Well, they went into the variable IQ on my computer. You can do the same on your computer too by copying the above code. 10,000 numbers is too many numbers to look at. We can look at the first 100 like this: print(IQ[1:100]) ## [1] 127 123 82 130 90 107 105 95 117 83 47 118 136 126 89 94 99 ## [18] 91 92 114 109 82 127 122 105 114 89 80 113 94 117 85 101 118 ## [35] 102 110 82 93 102 82 132 109 106 105 93 107 86 100 103 110 113 ## [52] 104 84 99 133 93 98 109 101 120 90 83 91 102 107 99 109 73 ## [69] 112 90 98 107 89 79 84 74 93 128 101 101 116 100 80 104 87 ## [86] 82 110 92 74 104 82 96 88 113 83 109 95 109 97 91 We can compute the mean IQ using the command mean(IQ) and the standard deviation using the command sd(IQ), and draw a histgram using hist(). The histogram of this much larger sample is shown in Figure 4.4c. Even a moment’s inspections makes clear that the larger sample is a much better approximation to the true population distribution than the smaller one. This is reflected in the sample statistics: the mean IQ for the larger sample turns out to be 99.9, and the standard deviation is 15.1. These values are now very close to the true population. I feel a bit silly saying this, but the thing I want you to take away from this is that large samples generally give you better information. I feel silly saying it because it’s so bloody obvious that it shouldn’t need to be said. In fact, it’s such an obvious point that when Jacob Bernoulli – one of the founders of probability theory – formalised this idea back in 1713, he was kind of a jerk about it. Here’s how he described the fact that we all share this intuition: For even the most stupid of men, by some instinct of nature, by himself and without any instruction (which is a remarkable thing), is convinced that the more observations have been made, the less danger there is of wandering from one’s goal (see Stigler, 1986, p65). Okay, so the passage comes across as a bit condescending (not to mention sexist), but his main point is correct: it really does feel obvious that more data will give you better answers. The question is, why is this so? Not surprisingly, this intuition that we all share turns out to be correct, and statisticians refer to it as the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that applies to many different sample statistics, but the simplest way to think about it is as a law about averages. The sample mean is the most obvious example of a statistic that relies on averaging (because that’s what the mean is… an average), so let’s look at that. When applied to the sample mean, what the law of large numbers states is that as the sample gets larger, the sample mean tends to get closer to the true population mean. Or, to say it a little bit more precisely, as the sample size “approaches” infinity (written as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) the sample mean approaches the population mean (\\(\\bar{X} \\rightarrow \\mu\\)). I don’t intend to subject you to a proof that the law of large numbers is true, but it’s one of the most important tools for statistical theory. The law of large numbers is the thing we can use to justify our belief that collecting more and more data will eventually lead us to the truth. For any particular data set, the sample statistics that we calculate from it will be wrong, but the law of large numbers tells us that if we keep collecting more data those sample statistics will tend to get closer and closer to the true population parameters. 4.3 Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem The law of large numbers is a very powerful tool, but it’s not going to be good enough to answer all our questions. Among other things, all it gives us is a “long run guarantee”. In the long run, if we were somehow able to collect an infinite amount of data, then the law of large numbers guarantees that our sample statistics will be correct. But as John Maynard Keynes famously argued in economics, a long run guarantee is of little use in real life: [The] long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task, if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us, that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again. Keynes (1923, 80) As in economics, so too in psychology and statistics. It is not enough to know that we will eventually arrive at the right answer when calculating the sample mean. Knowing that an infinitely large data set will tell me the exact value of the population mean is cold comfort when my actual data set has a sample size of \\(N=100\\). In real life, then, we must know something about the behaviour of the sample mean when it is calculated from a more modest data set! 4.3.1 Sampling distribution of the sample means “Oh no, what is the sample distribution of the sample means? Is that even allowed in English?”. Yes, unfortunately, this is allowed. The sampling distribution of the sample means is the next most important thing you will need to understand. IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO USE ALL CAPS. It is only confusing at first because it’s long and uses sampling and sample in the same phrase. Don’t worry, we’ve been prepping you for this. You know what a distribution is right? It’s where numbers comes from. It makes some numbers occur more or less frequently, or the same as other numbers. You know what a sample is right? It’s the numbers we take from a distribution. So, what could the sampling distribution of the sample means refer to? First, what do you think the sample means refers to? Well, if you took a sample of numbers, you would have a bunch of numbers…then, you could compute the mean of those numbers. The sample mean is the mean of the numbers in the sample. That is all. So, what is this distribution you speak of? Well, what if you took a bunch of samples of, put one here, put one there, put some other ones other places. You have a lot of different samples of numbers. You could compute the mean for each them. Then you would have a bunch of means. What do those means look like? Well, if you put them in a histogram, you could find out. If you did that, you would be looking at (roughly) a distribution, AKA the sampling distribution of the sample means. “I’m following along sort of, why would I want to do this instead of watching netflix…”. Because, the sampling distribution of the sample means gives you another window into chance. A very useful one that you can control, just like your remote control, by pressing the right design buttons. 4.3.1.1 Seeing the pieces To make a sampling distribution of the sample means, we just need the following: A distribution to take numbers from A bunch of different samples from the distribution The means of each of the samples Get all of the sample means, and plot them in a histogram Light Switch Experiment: You manipulate the switch up (condition 1 of independent variable), light goes on (measurement). You manipulate the switch down (condition 2 of independent variable), light goes off (another measurement). The measurement (light) changes (goes off and on) as a function of the manipulation (moving switch up or down). You can see the change in measurement between the conditions, it is as obvious as night and day. So, when you conduct a manipulation, and can see the difference (change) in your measure, you can be pretty confident that your manipulation is causing the change. note: to be cautious we can say “something” about your manipulation is causing the change, it might not be what you think it is if your manipulation is very complicated and involves lots of moving parts. 4.3.2 Chance can produce differences Do you think random chance can produce the appearance of differences, even when they really aren’t any? I hope so. We have already shown that the process of sampling numbers from a distribution is chancy process that produces different samples. Different samples are different, so yes, chance can produce differences. This can muck up our interpretation of experiments. Let’s conduct a fictitious experiment where we expect to find no differences, because we will manipulate something that shouldn’t do anything. Her’s the set-up: You are the experimenter standing in front of a gumball machine. It is very big, has thousands of gumballs. 50% of the gumballs are green, and 50% are red. You want to find out if picking gumballs with your right hand vs. your left hand will cause you to pick more green gumballs. Plus, you will be blindfolded the entire time. The independent variable is Hand: right hand vs. left hand. The dependent variable is the measurement of the color of each gumball. You run the experiment as follows. 1) put on blind fold. 2) pick 10 gumballs randomly with left hand, set them aside. 3) pick 10 gumballs randomly with right hand, set them aside. 4) count the number of green and red gumballs chosen by your left hand, and count the number of green and red gumballs chosedn by your right hand. Hopefully you will agree that your hands will not be able to tell the difference between the gumballs. If you don’t agree, we will further stipulate the gumballs are completely identical in every way except their color, so it would be impossible to tell them apart using your hands. So, what should happen in this experiment? “Umm, maybe you get 5 red gum balls and 5 green balls from your left hand, and also from your right hand?”. Sort of yes, this is what you would usually get. But, it is not all that you can get. Here is some data showing what happened from one pretend experiment: hand gumball left 1 left 1 left 0 left 1 left 1 left 0 left 0 left 0 left 0 left 0 right 0 right 0 right 1 right 0 right 1 right 1 right 1 right 0 right 1 right 0 “What am I looking at here”. This is a long-format table. Each row is one gumball. The first column tells you what hand was used. The second column tells you what kind of gumball. We will say 1s stand for green gum balls, and 0s stand for red gumballs. So, did your left hand cause you to pick more green gumballs than your right hand? It would be easier to look at the data using a bar graph. To keep things simple, we will only count green gumablls (the other gumballs must be red). So, all we need to do is sum up the 1s. The 0s won’t add anything. Oh look, the bars are not the same. One hand picked more green gum balls than the other. Does this mean that one of your hands secretly knows how to find green gumballs? No, it’s just another case of sampling error, that thing we call luck or chance. The difference here is caused by chance, not by the manipulation (which hand you use). Major problem for inference alert. We run experiments to look for differences so we can make inferences about whether our manipulations cause change in our measures. Now we know that we can find differences by chance. How can we know if a difference is real, or just caused by chance? 4.3.3 Differences due to chance can be simulated Remember when we showed that chance can produce correlations. We also showed that chance is restricted in its ability to produce correlations. For example, chance more often produces weak correlations than strong correlations. Remember the window of chance? We found out before that correlations falling outside the window of chance were very unlikely. We can do the same thing for differences. Let’s find out just what chance can do in our experiment. Once we know what chance is capable of we will be in a better position to judge whether our manipulation caused a difference, or whether it could have been chance. The first thing to do is pretend you conduct the gumball experiment 10 times in a row. This will produce 10 different sets of results. For each of them we can make a bar graph, and look at whether the left hand chose more green gumballs than red gumballs. It looks like this: These 10 experiments give us a better look at what chance can do. It should also mesh well with your expectations. If everything is left up to chance (as we have made it so), then sometimes your left hand will choose more green balls, sometimes your right hand will choose more green gumballs, and sometimes they will choose the same amount of gumballs. Right? Right. 4.4 Chance makes some differences more likely than others Ok, we have seen that chance can produce differences here. But, we still don’t have a good idea about what chance usually does and doesn’t do. For example, if we could find the window of opportunity here, we would be able find out that chance usually does not produce differences of a certain large size. If we knew what the size was, then if we ran experiment and our difference was bigger than what chance can do, we could be confident that chance did not produce our difference. Let’s use the word difference some more, because it will be helpful. In fact, let’s think about our measure of green balls in terms of a difference. For example, in each experiment we counted the green balls for the left and right hand. What we really want to know is if there is a difference between them. So, we can calculate the difference score. Let’s decide that difference score = # of green gumballs in left hand - # of green gumballs in right hand. Now, we can redraw the 10 bar graphs from above. But this time we will only see one bar for each experiment. This bar will show the differenced in number of green gumballs. Missing bars mean that there were an equal number of green gumballs chosen by the left and righ hands (difference score is 0). A positive value means that more green gumballs were chosen by the left than right hand. A negative value means that more green gumballs were chosen by the right than left hand. Note that if we decided (and we get to decide) to calculate the difference in reverse (right hand - left hand), ths signs of the differences scores would flip around. We are starting to see more of the differences that chance can produce. The difference scores are mostly between -2 to +2. We could get an even better impression by running this pretend experiment 100 times instead of only 10 times. How about we do that. OOf, we just ran so many simulated expeirments that the x-axis is unreadable, but it goes from 1 to 100. Each bar represents the difference of number of green balls chosen randomly by the left or right hand. Beginning to notice anything? Look at the y-axis, this shows the size of the difference. Yes, there are lots of bars of different sizes, this shows us that many kinds of differences do occur by chance. However, the y-axis is also restricted. It does not go from -10 to +10. Big differences greater than 5 or -5 don’t happen very often. Now that we have a method for simulating differences due to chance, let’s run 10,000 simulated experiments. But, instead of plotting the differences in a bar graph for each experiment, how about we look at the histogram of difference scores. This will give us a clearer picture about which differences happen most often, and which ones do not. This will be another window into chance. The chance window of differences. Our computer simulation allows us to force chance to operate hundreds of times, each time it produces a difference. We record the difference, then at the end of the simulation we plot the histogram of the differences. The histogram begins to show us the where the differences came from. Remember the idea that numbers come from a distribution, and the distribution says how often each number occurs. We are looking at one of these distributions. It is showing us that chance produces some differences more often than others. First, chance usually produces 0 differences, that’s the biggest bar in the middle. Chance also produces larger differences, but as the differences get larger (positive or negative), they occur less frequently. The shape of this histogram is your chance window, it tells you what chance can do, it tells you what chance usually does, and what it usually does not do. You can use this chance window to help you make inferences. If you ran yourself in the gumball experiment and found that your left hand chose 2 more green gumballs than red gumballs, would you conclude that you left hand was special, and caused you to choose more green gumballs? Hopefully not. You could look at the chance window and see that differences of size +2 do happen fairly often by chance alone. You should not be surprised if you got a luck +2 difference. However, what if your left chose 5 more green gumballs than red gumballs. Well, chance doesn’t do this very often, you might think something is up with your left hand. If you got a whopping 9 more green gumballs than red gumballs, you might really start to wonder. This is the kind of thing that could happen (it’s possible), but virtually never happens. When you get things that almost never happen by chance, you can be more confident that the difference reflects a causal force that is not chance. 4.5 The Crump Test We are going to be doing alot of inference throughout the rest of this course. Pretty much all of it will come down to one question. Did chance produce the differences in my data? We will talking about experiments mostly, and in experiments we want to know if our manipulation caused a difference in our measurement. But, we measure things that have natural variability, so everywhere time we measure things we will always find a difference. We want to know if the difference we found (between our experimental conditions) could have been produced by chance. If chance is a very unlikely explanation of our observed difference, we will make the inference that chance did not produce the difference, and that something about our experimental manipulation did produce the difference. This is it (for this textbook). Statistics is not only about determining whether chance could have produced a pattern in the observed data. The same tools we are talking about here can be generalized to ask whether any kind of distribution could have produced the differences. This allows comparisons between different models of the data, to see which one was the most likely, rather than just rejecting the unlikely ones (e.g., chance). But, we’ll leave those advanced topics for another textbook. This chapter is about building intuitions for making these kinds of inferences about the role of chance in your data. It’s not clear to me what are the best things to say, to build up your intuitions for how to do statistical inference. So, this chapter tries different things, some of them standard, and some of them made up. What you are about to read, is a made up way of doing statistical inference, without using the jargon that we normally use to talk about it. The goal is to do things without formulas, and without probabilities, and just work with some ideas using simulations to see what happens. We will look at what chance can do, then we will talk about what needs to happen in your data in order for you to be confident that chance didn’t do it. 4.5.1 Intuitive methods Warning, this is an unoffical statistical test made up by Matt Crump. It makes sense to him (me), and if it turns out someone else already made this up, then Crump didn’t do his homework, and we will change the name of this test to it’s original author. The point of this test is to show how simple operations that you already understand can be used to create a tool for inference. This test is not complicated, it uses Sampling numbers randomly from a distribution Adding, substracting Division, to find the mean Counting Graphing and drawing lines NO FORMULAS 4.5.2 Part 1: Frequency based intuition about occurence Question: How many times does something need to happen, for it to happen alot? Or, how many times does something need to happen for it to happen not very much, or even really not at all? Small enough for you to not worry about it at all happening to you? Would you go outside everyday if you thought that you would get hit by lightning 1 out of 10 times? I wouldn’t. You’d probably be hit by lightning more than once per month, you’d be dead pretty quickly. 1 out of 10 is alot (to me, maybe not to you, there’s no right answer here). Would you go outside everyday if you thought that you would get hit by lightning 1 out of every 100 days? Jeez, that’s a tough one. What would I even do? If I went out everyday, I’d probably be dead in a year! Maybe I would go out 2 or 3 times per year, I’m risky like that, but I’d probably live longer. It would massively suck. Would you go outside everyday if you thought you would get hit by lightning 1 out of every 1000 days? Well, you’d probably be dead in 3-6 years if you did that. Are you a gambler? Maybe go out once per month, still sucks. Would you go outside everyday if you thought lightning would get you 1 out every 10,000 days? 10,000 is a bigger number, harder to think about. It’s about once every 27 years. Ya, I’d probably go out 150 days per year, and live a bit longer if I can. Would you go outside everyday if you thought lightning would get you 1 out every 100,000 days? 100,000 is a bigger number, harder to think about. How many years is that? It’s about 273 years. With those odds, I’d probably go out all the time and forget about being hit by lightning. It doesn’t happen very often, and if it does, c’est la vie. The point of considering these questions is to get a sense for yourself of what happens alot, and what doesn’t happen alot, and how you would make important decisions based on what happens alot and what doesn’t. 4.5.3 Part 2: Simulating chance This next part could happen a bunch of ways, I’ll make loads of assumptions that I won’t defend, and I won’t claim the Crump test has problems. I will claim it helps us make an inference about whether chance could have produced some differences in data. We’ve already been introduced to simulating things, so we’ll do that again. Here is what we will do. I am cognitive psychologist who happens to be measuring X. Because of prior research in the field, I know that when I measure X, my samples will tend to have a particular mean and standard deviation. Let’s say the mean is usually 100, and the standard deviation is usually 15. In this case, I don’t care about using these numbers as estimates of the population parameters, I’m just thinking about what my samples usually look like. What I want to know is how they behave when I sample them. I want to see what kind of samples happen alot, and what kind of sample don’t happen alot. Now, I also live in the real world, and in the real world when I run experiments to see what changes X, I usually only have access to some number of participants, who I am very grateful too, because they participate in my experiments. Let’s say I usually can run 20 subjects in each condition in my experiments. Let’s keep the experiment simple, with two conditions, so I will need 40 total subjects. I would like to learn something to help me with inference. One thing I would like to learn is what the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks like. This distribution tells me what kinds of mean values happen alot, and what kinds dont’t happen very often. But, I’m actually going to skip that bit. Because what I’m really interested in is what the sampling distribution of the difference between my sample means looks like. After all, I am going to run an experiment with 20 people in one condition, and 20 people in the other. Then I am going to calculate the mean for group A, and the mean for group B, and I’m going to look a the difference. I will probably find a difference, but my question is, did my manipulation cause this difference, or is this the kind of thing that happens alot by chance. If I knew what chance can do, and how often it produces differences of particular sizes, I could look at the difference I observed, then look at what chance can do, and then I can make a decision! If my difference doesn’t happen alot (we’ll get to how much not alot is in a bit), then I might be willing to believe that my manipulation caused a difference. If my difference happens all the time by chance alone, then I wouldn’t be inclined to think my manipulation caused the difference, because it could have been chance. So, here’s what we’ll do, even before running the experiment. We’ll do a simulation. We will sample numbers for group A and Group B, then compute the means for group A and group B, then we will find the difference in the means between group A and group B. But, we will do one very important thing. We will pretend that we haven’t actually done a manipulation. If we do this (do nothing, no manipulatio that could cause a difference), then we know that only sampling error could cause any differences betwen the mean of group A and group B. We’ve eliminated all other causes, only chance is left. By doing this, we will be able to see exactly what chance can do. More importantly, we will see the kinds of differences that occur alot, and the kinds that don’t occur alot. Before we do the simulation, we need to answer one question. How much is alot? We could pick any number for alot. I’m going to pick 10,000. That is alot. If something happens only 1 times out 10,000, I am willing to say that is not alot. Ok, now we have our number, we are going to simulate the possible mean differences between group A and group B that could arise by chance. We do this 10,000 times. This gives chance alot of opportunity to show us what it does do, and what it does not do. This is what I did: I sampled 20 numbers into group A, and 20 into group B. The numbers both came from the same normal distribution, with mean = 100, and standard deviation = 15. Because the samples are coming from the same distribution, we expect that on average they will be similar (but we already know that samples differ from one another). Then, I compute the mean for each sample, and compute the difference between the means. I save the mean difference score, and end up with 10,000 of them. Then I draw a histogram. It looks like this: Sidenote: Of course, we might recognize that chance could do a difference greater than 15. We just didn’t give it the opportunity. We only ran the simulation 10,000 times. If we ran it on million times, maybe a difference greater than 20 would happen a couple times. If we ran it a bazillion gazillion times, maybe a difference greater than 30 would happen a couple times. If we go out to infinity, then chance might produce all sorts of bigger differences once in a while. But, we’ve already decided that 1/10,000 is not alot. So things that happen 0/10,000 times, like differences greater than 15, just don’t happen very much. Now we can see what chance can do to the size of our mean difference. The x-axis shows the size of the mean difference. We took our samples from the sample distribution, so the difference between them should usually be 0. Look this is what usually happens. Pause for a second. Why should the mean differences usually be zero, wasn’t the population mean = 100, shouldn’t they be around 100? No. The mean of group A will tend to be around 100, and the meand of group B will tend be around 100. So, the difference score will tend to be 100-100 = 0. That is why we expect a mean difference of zero when the samples are drawn from the same population. So, differences near zero happen the most, that’s good, that’s what we expect. Bigger or smaller differences happen increasingly less often. Differences greater than 15 or -15 never happen at all. For our purposes, it looks like chance only produces differences between -15 to 15. Ok, let’s ask a couple simple questions. What was the biggest negative number that occured in the simulation? We’ll use R for this. All of the 10,000 difference scores are stored in a variable I made called difference. If we want to find the minimum value, we use the min function. Here’s the result. min(difference) ## [1] -16.99839 Ok, so what was the biggest positive number that occurred? Let’s use the max function to find out. It finds the biggest (maximum) value in the variable. FYI, we’ve just computed the range, the minimum and maximum numbers in the data. Remember we learned that before. Anyway, here’s the max. max(difference) ## [1] 19.80213 Both of these extreme values only occurred once. Because of the scale of the histogram, we couldn’t even see them on there, the bar was so small. The biggest negative and postive numbers are pretty much the same if you ignore their sign. What can we say about these numbers. Well since they are the most extreme values, we can say something like a number this big (ignoring sign) happens about 2 times out of 10,000. Is that alot. Not to me. It’s not alot. So, how often does a difference of 20 occur out of 10,000. Well, we don’t really know, but it didn’t occur here, so going with what we got, we say 0 out of 10,000. That’s never. We’re about to move into part three, which involves drawing lines and talking about them. The really important part about part 3 is this. What would you say if you ran this experiment once, and found a mean difference of 30? I would say it happens 0 times of out 10,000 by chance. I would say chance did not produce my difference of 30. That’s what I would say. We’re going to expand upon this right now. 4.5.4 Part 3: Judgment and Decision-making Remember, we haven’t even conducted an experiment. We’re just simulating what could happen if we did conduct an experiment. We made a histogram. We can see that chance produces some differences more than others, and that chance never produced really big differences. What should we do with this information? What we are going to do is talk about judgment and decision making. About what you ask? Well, when you finally do run an experiment, you will get two means for group A and B, and then you will need to make need to make some judgments, and perhaps even a decision, if you are so inclined. You will need to judge whether chance (sampling error) could have produced the difference you observed. If you judge that it did it not, you might make the deciion to tell people that your experimental manipulation actuall works. If you judge that it could have been chance, you might make a different decision. These are important decisions for researchers. Their careers can depend on them. Also, their decisions matter for the public. Nobody wants to hear fake news from the media about scientific findings. So, what we are doing is preparing to make those judgments. We are going to draw up a plan, before we even see the data, for how we will make judgments and decisions about what we find. This kind of planning is extremely important, because we discuss in part 4, that your planning can help you design an even better experiment than the one you might have been intending to run. This kind of planning can also be used to interpret other people’s results, as a way of double-checking checking whether you believe those results are plausible. The thing about judgement and decision making is that reasonable people disagree about how to do it, and unreasonable people really disagree about it. What are we going to do? Furthermore, statisticians and reseachers disagree about how to do it. I will propose some things that people will disagree with. That’s ok, these things still make sense. And, the disagreeable things point to important problems that are hard to solve for any “real” statistical inference test. Let’s talk about some objective facts from our simulation of 10,000 things that we definetly know to be true. For example, we can draw some lines on the graph, and label some different regions. We’ll talk about two kinds of regions. Region of chance. Chance did it. Chance could have done it Region of not chance. Chance didn’t do it. Chance couldn’t have done it. The regions are defined by the minimum value and the maximum value. Chance never produced a smaller or bigger number. The region inside the range is what chance did do, and the the region outside the range on both sides is what chance never did. It looks like this: We have just drawn some lines, and shaded some regions, and made one plan we could use to make decisions. How would the decisions work. Let’s say you ran the experiment and found a mean difference between groups A and B of 25. Where is 25 in the figure? It’s in the green part. What does the green part say? NOT CHANCE. What does this mean. It means chance never made a difference of 25. It did that 0 out of 10,000 times. If we found a difference of 25, perhaps we could confidently conclude that chance did not cause the difference. If I found a difference of 25 with this kind of data, I’d be pretty confident that my experimental manipulation caused the difference, because obviously chance never does. What about a difference of +10? That’s in the red part, where chance lives. Chance could have done a difference of because we can see that it did do that. The red part is the window of what chance did in our simulation. Anything inside the window could have been a difference caused by chance. If I found a difference of +10, I’d say, coulda been been chance. I would not be very confident that my experimental manipulation caused the difference. Statistical inference could be this easy. The number you get from your experiment could be in the chance window (then you can’t rule out chance as a cause), or it could be outside the chance window (then you can rule out chance). Case closed. Let’s all go home. 4.5.4.1 Grey areas So what’s the problem? Depending on who you are, and what kinds of risks you’re willing to take, there might not be a problem. But, if you are just even a little bit risky then there is a problem that makes clear judgments about the role of chance difficult. We would like to say chance did or did not cause our difference. But, we’re really always in the position of admitting that it could have sometimes, or wouldn’t have most times. These are wishy washy statements, they are in between yes or no. That’s ok. Grey is a color too, let’s give grey some respect. “What grey areas are you talking about?, I only see red or green, am I grey blind?”. Let’s look at where some grey areas might be. I say might be, because people disagree about where the grey is. People have different comfort levels with grey. Here’s my opinion on some clear grey areas. I made two grey areas, and they are reddish gray, because we are still in the chance window. There are question marks (?) in the grey areas. Why? The question marks reflect some uncertainty that we have about thos particular differences. For example, if you found a difference that was in a grey area, say a 15. 15 is less than the maximum, which means chance did create differences of around 15. But, difference of 15 don’t happen very often. What can you conclude or say about this 15 you found? Can you say without a doubt that chance did not produce the difference? Of course not, you know that chance could have. Can you say without a doubt that chance did produce the difference? Well, no not really. Chance doesn’t do this very often. It’s one of those things that doesn’t happen alot. That makes chance a not very plausible explanation. Instead, you might be willing to take the risk, and say that your experimental manipulation caused the difference. You’d be making a bet that it wasn’t chance. But, could be a safe bet, since you know the odds are in your favor. You might be thinking that your grey areas aren’t the same as the ones I’ve drawn. Maybe you want to be more conservative, and make them smaller. Or, maybe you’re more risky, and would make them bigger. Or, maybe you’d add some grey area going in a little bit to the green area (after all, chance could probably produce some bigger sometimes, and to avoid those you would have to make the grey area go a bit into the green area). Another thing to think about is your decision policy. What will you do, when your observed difference is in your grey area? Will you always make the ame decision about the role of chance? Or, will you sometimes flip-flop depending on how you feel. Perhaps, you think that there shouldn’e be a strict policy, and that you should accept some level of uncertainty. The difference you found be a real one, or it might not. There’s uncertainty, hard to avoid that. So let’s illustrate one more kind of strategy for making decisions. We just talked about one that had some lines, and some regions. This makes it seem like we can either rule out, or not rule out the role of chance. Another way of looking at things is that everything is a different shade of grey. It looks like this: Ok, so I made it shades of blue (because it was easier in R). Now we can see two decision plans at the same time. Notice that as the bars get shorter, they also get become a darker stronger blue. The color can be used as a guide to how confident you should be about your manipulation causing the difference rather than chance. If you found a difference near a really dark bar, those don’t happen often by chance, so you might be really confident that chance didn’t do it. If you find a difference near a slightly lighter blue bar, you might be slightly less confident. That is all. You run your experiment, you get your data, then you have some amount of confidence that it wasn’t produced by chance. This way of thinking is elaborated to very interesting degrees in the Bayesian world of statistics. We don’t wade too much into that, but mention it a little bit here and there. It’s worth knowing it’s out there. 4.5.4.2 Making Bad Decisions No matter how you plan to make decisions about your data, you will always be prone to making some mistakes. You might call one finding real, when in fact it was caused by chance. This is called a type I error, or a false positive. You might ignore one finding, calling it chance, when in fact it wasn’t chance (even though it was in the window). This is called a ** type II**, or a false negative. How you make decisions can influence how often you make errors over time. If you are a researcher, you will run lots of experiments, and you will make some amount of mistakes over time. If you do something like the very strict method of only accepting results as real when they are in the “no chance” zone, then you won’t make many type I errors. Pretty much all of your result will be real. But, you’ll also make type II errors, because you will miss things real things that your decision criteria says are due to chance. The opposite also holds. If you are willing to be more liberal, and accept results in the grey as real, then you will make more type I errors, but you wont’ make as many type II errors. Under the decision strategy of using these cutoff regions for decision-making, there is a necessary tradeoff. The Bayesian view get’s around this a little bit. Bayesians talk about updating their beliefs and confidence over time. In that view, all you ever have is some level of confidence about whether something is real, and by running more experiments you can increase or decrease your level of confidence. This, in some fashion, avoids some tradeoff between type I and type II errors. Regardless, there is another way to avoid type I and type II errors, and to increase your confidence in your results, even before you do the experiment. It’s called “knowing how to design a good experiment”. 4.5.5 Part 4: Experiment Design We’ve seen what chance can do. Now we run an experiment. We manipulate something between groups A and B, get the data, calculate the group means, then look at the difference. Then we cross all of our finger and toes, and hope beyond hope that the difference is big enough to not be caused by chance. That’s alot of hope. Here’s the thing, we don’t often know how strong our manipulation is in the first place. So, even it can cause a change, we don’t necessarilly know how much change it can cause. That’s why we’re running the experiment. Many manipulations in Psychology are not strong enough to cause big changes. This is a problem for detecting these smallish causal forces. In our fake example, you could easily manipulate something that has a tiny influence, and will never push the mean difference past say 5 or 10. In our simulation, we need something more like a 15 or 17 or a 21, or hey, a 30 would be great, chance never does that. Let’s say your manipulation is listening to music or not listening to music. Music listening might change something about X, but if it only changes X by +5, you’ll never be able to confidently say it wasn’t chance. And, it’s not that easy to completely change music and make music super strong in the music condition so it really causes a change in X compared to the no music condition. EXPERIMENT DESIGN TO THE RESCUE! Newsflash, it is often possible to change how you run your experiment so that it is more sensitive to smaller effects. How do you think we can do this? Here is a hint. It’s the stuff you learned about the sampling distribution of the sample mean, and the role of sample-size. What happens to the sampling distribution of the sample mean when N (sample size)? The distribution gets narrower and narrower, an starts to look the a single number (the hypotheticaal mean of the hypothetical population). That’s great. If you switch to thinking about mean difference scores, like the distribution we created in this test, what do you think will happen to that distribution as we increase N? It will will also shrink. As we increase N to infinity, it will shrink to 0. Which means that, when N is infinity, chance never produces any differences at all. We can use this. For example, we could run our experiment with 20 subjects in each group. Or, we could decide to invest more time and run 40 subjects in each group, or 80, or 150. When you are the experimenter, you get to decide the design. These decision matter big time. Basically, the more subjects you have, the more sensitive your experiment. With bigger N, you will be able to reliably detect smaller mean differences, and be able to confidently conclude that chance did not produce those small effects. Check out this next set of histograms. All we are doing is the very same simulation as before, but this time we do it for different sample-sizes: 20, 40, 80, 160. We are doubling our sample-size across each simulation just to see what happens to the width of the chance window. There you have it. The sampling distribution of the mean differences shrinks toward 0 as sample-size increases. This means if you run an experiment with a larger sample-size, you will be able to detect smaller mean differences, and be confident they aren’t due to chance. Let’s look at a table of the minimum and maximum values that chance produced across these four sample-sizes: sample_size smallest biggest 20 -23.88891 25.066661 40 -16.03156 17.337819 80 -11.86226 14.728190 160 -7.72644 8.455775 The table is telling. The range of chance’s behavior is very wide for sample-size 20, but about half as wide for sample-size 160. If it turns out your manipulation will cause a difference of +11, then what should you do? Run an experiment with 20 people? I hope not. If you did that, you could get +11s fairly often by chance. If you ran the experiment with 160, then you definetly be able to say that +11 was not due to chance, it would be outside the range of what chance can do. You could even consider running the experiment with 80 subjects. A +11 there wouldn’t happen often by chance, and you’d be cost-effective, spending less time on the experiment. The point is: the design of the experiment determines the sizes of the effects it can detect. If you want to detect a small effect. Make your sample size bigger. It’s really important to say this is not the only thing you can do. You can also make your cell-sizes bigger. For example, often times we take several measurements from a single subject. The more measurements you take (cell-size), the more stable your estimate of the subject’s mean. We discuss these issues more later. You can also make a stronger manipulation, when possible. 4.5.6 Part 5: I have the power By the power of greyskull, I HAVE THE POWER - He-man The last thing we’ll talk about here is something called power. In fact, we are going to talk about the concept of power, not actual power. It’s confusing now, but later we will define power in terms of some particular ideas about statistical inference. Here, we will just talk about the idea. And, we’ll show how to make sure your design has 100% power. Because, why not. Why run a design that doesn’t have the power? The big idea behind power is the concept of sensitivity. The concept of sensitivity assumes that there is something to be sensitive to. That is, there is some real difference that can be measured. So, the question is, how sensitive is your experiment? We’ve already seen that the number of subjects (sample-size), changes the sensitivity of the design. More subjects, more sensitivity to smaller effects. Let’s take a look at one more plot. What we will do is simulate a measure of sensitivity across a whole bunch of sample sizes, from 10 to 300. We’ll do this in steps of 10. For each simluation, we’ll compute the mean differences as we have done. But, rather than showing the histogram, we’ll just compute the smallest value and the largest value. This is a pretty good measure of the outer reach of chance. Then we’ll just plot those values as a function of sample size and see what we’ve got. What we have here is a reasonably precise window of sensitivity as a function of sample size. For each sample size, we can see the maximum difference that chance produced, and the minimum difference. In those simulations, chance never produced bigger or smaller differences. So, each design is sensitive to any difference that is underneath the bottom line, or above the top line. It’s really that simple. Here’s another way of putting it. Which of the sample sizes will be sensitive to a difference of +10 or -10. That is, if a difference of +10 or -10 was observed, then we could very confidently say that the difference was not due to chance, because according to these simulations, chance never produced differences that big. To help us see which ones are sensitive, let’s draw some horizontal lines at -10 and +10. I would say all of the designs with sample size = 100 or greater are all perfectly sensitive to real differences of 10 (if they exist). We can see that all of the dots after sample size 100 are underneath the red line. So effects that are as big as the red line, or bigger will almost never occur due to chance. But, if they do occur in nature, those experiments will detect them straight away. That is sensitivity. And, designing your experiment so that you know it is sensitive to the thing you are looking for is the big idea behind power. It’s worth this kind of thing before you run your experiment. Why waste your own time and run an experiment that doesn’t have a chance of detecting the thing you are looking for. 4.5.7 Summary of Crump Test What did we learn from this so-called fake Crump test that nobody uses? Well, we learned the basics of what we’ll be doing moving forward. And, we did it all without any hard math or formulas. We sampled numbers, we computed means, we subtracted means, then we did that alot and counted up the means and put them in a histogram. This showed us what chance do in an experiment. Then, we discussed how to make decisions around these facts. And, we showed how we can manipulate the role of chance just by changing things like sample size. 4.6 The randomization test (permutation test) Welcome to the first official inferential statistic in this textbook. Up to now we have been building some intuitions for you. Now, we will get slightly more formal and show you how we can use random chance to tell use whether our experimental finding was likely due to chance or not. We do this with something called a randomization test. The ideas behind the randomization test are the very same ideas behind the rest of the inferential statistics that we will talk about in later chapters. And, surprise, we have already talked about all of the major ideas already. Now, we will just put the ideas together, and give them the name randomization test. Here’s the big idea. When you run an experiment and collect some data you find out what happened. But, because you ran the experiment only once, you don’t get to find out what could have happened. The randomization test is a way of finding out what could have happened. And, once you know that, you can compare what did happen in your experiment, with what could have happened. 4.6.1 Pretend example does chewing gum improve your grades? Let’s say you run an experiment to find out if chewing gum causes students to get better grades on statistics exams. You randomly assign 20 students to the chewing gum condition, and 20 different students to the no-chewing gum condition. Then, you give everybody statistics tests and measure their grades. If chewing gum causes better grades, then the chewing gum group should have higher grades on average than the group who did not chew gum. Let’s say the data looked like this: student gum no_gum 1 78 74 2 99 64 3 84 43 4 85 51 5 81 52 6 99 75 7 88 58 8 78 59 9 89 41 10 90 87 11 97 81 12 73 78 13 80 63 14 86 71 15 95 88 16 73 81 17 99 52 18 90 87 19 92 50 20 86 87 Sums 1742 1342 Means 87.1 67.1 So, did the students chewing gum do better than the students who didn’t chew gum? Look at the mean test performance at the bottom of the table. The mean for students chewing gum was 87.1, and the mean for students who did not chew gum was 67.1. Just looking at the means, it looks like chewing gum worked! “STOP THE PRESSES, this is silly”. We already know this is silly because we are making pretend data. But, even if this was real data, you might think, “Chewing gum won’t do anything, this difference could have been caused by chance, I mean, maybe the better students just happened to be put into the chewing group, so because of that their grades were higher, chewing gum didn’t do anything…”. We agree. But, let’s take a closer look. We already know how the data come out. What we want to know is how they could have come out, what are all the possibilities? For example, the data would have come out a bit different if we happened to have put some of the students from the gum group into the no gum group, and vice versa. Think of all the ways you could have assigned the 40 students into two groups, there are lots of ways. And, the means for each group would turn out differently depending on how the students are assigned to each group. Practically speaking, it’s not possible to run the experiment every possible way, that would take too long. But, we can nevertheless estimate how all of those experiments might have turned out using simulation. Here’s the idea. We will take the 40 measurements (exam scores) that we found for all the students. Then we will randomly take 20 of them and pretend they were in the gum group, and we’ll take the remaining 20 and pretend they were in the no gum group. Then we can compute the means again to find out what would have happened. We can keep doing this over and over again. Everytime computing what happened in that version of the experiment. 4.6.1.1 Doing the randomization Before we do that, let’s show how the randomization part works. We’ll use fewer numbers to make the process easier to look at. Here are the first 5 exam scores for students in both groups. student gum no_gum 1 78 74 2 99 64 3 84 43 4 85 51 5 81 52 Sums 427 284 Means 85.4 56.8 Things could have turned out differently if some of the subjects in the gum group were switched with the subjects in the no gum group. Here’s how we can do some random switching. We will do this using R. all_scores &lt;- c(gum[1:5],no_gum[1:5]) randomize_scores &lt;- sample(all_scores) new_gum &lt;- randomize_scores[1:5] new_no_gum &lt;- randomize_scores[6:10] print(new_gum) ## [1] 74 64 78 52 51 print(new_no_gum) ## [1] 84 85 99 43 81 We have taken the first 5 numbers from the original data, and put them all into a variable called all_scores. Then we use the sample function in R to shuffle the scores. Finally, we take the first 5 scores from the shuffled numbers and put them into a new variable called new_gum. Then, we put the last five scores into the variable new_no_gum. Then we printed them, so we can see them. If we do this a couple of times and put them in a table, we can indeed see that the means for gum and no gum would be different if the subjects were shuffled around. Check it out: student gum no_gum gum2 no_gum2 gum3 no_gum3 1 78 74 84 51 81 84 2 99 64 43 85 78 52 3 84 43 99 74 85 74 4 85 51 64 78 43 51 5 81 52 81 52 64 99 Sums 427 284 371 340 351 360 Means 85.4 56.8 74.2 68 70.2 72 4.6.1.2 Simulating the mean differences across the different randomizations In our pretend experiment we found that the mean for students chewing gum was 87.1, and the mean for students who did not chew gum was 67.1. The mean difference (gum - no gum) was 20. This is a pretty big difference. This is what did happend. But, what could have happened? If we tried out all of the experiments where different subjects were switched around, what does the distribution of the possible mean differences look like? Let’s find out. This is what the randomization test is all about. When we do our randomization test we will measure the mean difference in exam scores between the gum group and the no gum group. Every time we randomize we will save the mean difference. Let’s look at a short animation of what is happenining in the randomization test. Note, what you are about to see is data from a different fake experiment, but the principles are the same. We’ll return to the gum no gum experiment after the animiation. The animation is showing you three important things. First, the purple dots show you the mean scores in two groups (didn’t study vs study). It looks like there is a difference, as 1 dot is lower than the other. We want to know if chance could produce a difference this big. At the beginning of the animiation, the light green and red dots show the individual scores from each of 10 subjects in the design (the purple dots are the means of these original scores). Now, during the randomizations, we randomly shuffle the original scores between the groups. You can see this happening throughout the animation, as the green and red dots appear in different random combinations. The moving yellow dots show you the new means for each group after the randomization. The differences between the yellow dots show you the range of differences that chance could produce. What can we learn from this animation? Well, we are engaging in some visual statistical inference. By looking the range of motion of the yellow dots, we are watching what kind of differences chance can produce. In this animiation, the purple dots, representing the original difference, are outside of the range of chance. The yellow dots move past the purple dots. This is a way of showing that the random chance is very unlikely to produce the original difference. If the purple dots were inside the range of the yellow dots, then when would know that chance is capable of producing the difference we observed, and that it does so fairly often. As a result, we should not conclude the manipulation caused the difference, because it could have easily occured by chance. Let’s return to the gum example. After we randomized our scores many times, and computed the new means, and the mean differences, we will have loads of mean differences to look at, which we can plot in a histogram. The histogram gives a picture of what could have happened. Then, we can compare what did happen with what could have happened. Here’s the histogram of the mean differences from the randomization test. For this simulation, we randomized the results from the original experiment 1000 times. This is what could have happened. The blue line in the figure shows us where our observed difference lies on the x-axis. We are looking at another window of chance. We are seeing a histogram of the kinds of mean differences that could have occured in our experiemnt, if we had assigned our subjects to the gum and no gum groups differently. As you can see, the mean differences range from negative to positive. The most frequent difference is 0. Also, the distribution appears to be symmetrical about zero, which shows we had roughly same the chances of getting a positive or negative difference. Also, notice that as the differences get larger (in the positive or negative direction, they become less frequent). The blue line shows us the observed difference, this is the one we found in our fake experiment. Where is it? It’s way out to the right. It is is well outside the histogram. In other words, when we look at what could have happened, we see that what did happen doesn’t occur very often. IMPORTANT: In this case, when we speak of what could have happened. We are talking about what could have happended by chance. When we compare what did happen to what chance could have done, we can get a better idea of whether our result was caused by chance. What do you think? Could the difference represented by the blue line have been caused by chance? My answer is probably not. The histogram shows us the window of chance. The blue line is not inside the window. This means we can be pretty confident that the difference we observed was not due to chance. Ok, let’s pretend we got a much smaller mean difference when we first ran the experiment. For example, the histrogram might look something like this: Look at the blue line. If you found a mean difference of 10, would you be convinced that your difference was not caused by chance? As you can see, the blue line is inside the chance window. Notably, differences of +10 don’t very often. You might infer that you difference was not likely to be due to chance (but you might be a little bit skeptical, because it could have been). How about the red line? The red line represents a difference of +5. If you found a difference of +5 here, would you be confident that your difference was not caused by chance? I wouldn’t be. The red line is totally inside the chance window, this kind of difference happens fairly often. I’d need some more evidence to consider the claim the some independent variable actually caused the difference. I’d be much more comfortable assuming that sampling error probably caused the difference. 4.6.2 Take homes so far Have you noticed that we haven’t used any formulas yet, but we have been able to accomplish inferential statistics. We will see some formulas as we progress, but these aren’t really that important. What’s important is the idea behind the formulas. Inferential statistics is an attempt to solve the problem: where did my data from?. In the randomization test example, our question was: where did the differences between the means in my data come from?. We know that the differences could be produced by chance alone. We simulated what chance can due using randomization. Then we plotted what chance can do using a histogram. Then, we used to picture to help us make an inference. Did our observed difference come from the distribution, or not? When the observed difference is clearly inside the chance distribution, then we can infer that our difference could have been produced by chance. When the observed difference is not clearly inside the chance distribution, then we can infer that our difference was probably not produced by chance. In my opinion, these pictures are very, very helpful. If one of our goals is to help ourselves summarize a bunch of complicated numbers to arrive at an inference, then the pictures do a great job. We don’t even need a summary number, we just need to look at the picture and see if the observed differerence is inside or outside of the window. This is what it is all about. Creating intuitive and meaningful ways to make inferences from our data. As we move forward, the main thing that we will do is formalize our process, and talk more about “standard” inferential statistics. For example, rather than looking at a picture (which is a good thing to do), we will create some helpful numbers. For example, what if you wanted to the probability that your difference could have been produced by chance? That could be a single number, like 95%. If there was a 95% probability that chance can produce the difference you observed, you might not be very confident that something like your experimental manipulation was causing the difference. If there was only 1% probability that chance could produce your difference, then you might be more confident that chance did not produce the difference; and, you might instead be comfortable with the possibility that your experimental manipulation actually caused the differnce. So, how can we arrive at those numbers? In order to get there we will introduce you to some more foundational tools for statistical inference. References "],

In Chapter [multipleAndLogisticRegression], we explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical outcomes with two possible categories. 11.1 Introduction to multiple regression Multiple regression extends simple two-variable regression to the case that still has one response but many predictors (denoted \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), …). The method is motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output. We will consider Ebay auctions of a video game called Mario Kart for the Nintendo Wii. The outcome variable of interest is the total price of an auction, which is the highest bid plus the shipping cost. We will try to determine how total price is related to each characteristic in an auction while simultaneously controlling for other variables. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, are longer auctions associated with higher or lower prices? And, on average, how much more do buyers tend to pay for additional Wii wheels (plastic steering wheels that attach to the Wii controller) in auctions? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions. The data set includes results from 141 auctions.2 Four observations from this data set are shown in Table [marioKartDataMatrix], and descriptions for each variable are shown in Table [marioKartVariables]. Notice that the condition and stock photo variables are indicator variables. For instance, the variable takes value 1 if the game up for auction is new and 0 if it is used. Using indicator variables in place of category names allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. See Section [categoricalPredictorsWithTwoLevels] for additional details. Multiple regression also allows for categorical variables with many levels, though we do not have any such variables in this analysis, and we save these details for a second or third course. rrrrlr &amp; price &amp; cond_ new &amp; stock_ photo &amp; duration &amp; wheels 1 &amp; 51.55 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 2 &amp; 37.04 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 1 \\(\\vdots\\) &amp;\\(\\vdots\\) &amp;\\(\\vdots\\) &amp;\\(\\vdots\\) &amp;\\(\\vdots\\) &amp;\\(\\vdots\\) 140 &amp; 38.76 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 141 &amp; 54.51 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 [marioKartDataMatrix] Variables and their descriptions for the data set. variable description price final auction price plus shipping costs, in US dollars a coded two-level categorical variable, which takes value when the game is new and if the game is used a coded two-level categorical variable, which takes value if the primary photo used in the auction was a stock photo and if the photo was unique to that auction duration the length of the auction, in days, taking values from 1 to 10 wheels the number of Wii wheels included with the auction (a Wii wheel is a plastic racing wheel that holds the Wii controller and is an optional but helpful accessory for playing Mario Kart) [marioKartVariables] 11.1.1 A single-variable model for the Mario Kart data Let’s fit a linear regression model with the game’s condition as a predictor of auction price. The model may be written as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\widehat{price} &amp;= 42.87 + 10.90\\times cond\\_\\hspace{0.3mm}new\\end{aligned}\\] Results of this model are shown in Table [singleVarModelsForPriceUsingCond] and a scatterplot for price versus game condition is shown in Figure [marioKartSingle]. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std.

The least squares line is also shown. [marioKartSingle] Examine Figure [marioKartSingle]. Does the linear model seem ?3 Interpret the coefficient for the game’s condition in the model. Is this coefficient significantly different from 0? Note that is a two-level categorical variable that takes value 1 when the game is new and value 0 when the game is used. So 10.90 means that the model predicts an extra $10.90 for those games that are new versus those that are used. (See Section [categoricalPredictorsWithTwoLevels] for a review of the interpretation for two-level categorical predictor variables.) Examining the regression output in Table [singleVarModelsForPriceUsingCond], we can see that the p-value for is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence that the coefficient is different from zero when using this simple one-variable model. 11.1.2 Including and assessing many variables in a model Sometimes there are underlying structures or relationships between predictor variables. For instance, new games sold on Ebay tend to come with more Wii wheels, which may have led to higher prices for those auctions. We would like to fit a model that includes all potentially important variables simultaneously. This would help us evaluate the relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome while controlling for the potential influence of other variables. This is the strategy used in multiple regression. While we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression, such models are a common first step in providing evidence of a causal connection. We want to construct a model that accounts for not only the game condition, as in Section [twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData], but simultaneously accounts for three other variables: , duration, and wheels. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\textbf{price}} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times \\textbf{cond\\_\\hspace{0.3mm}new} + \\beta_2\\times \\textbf{stock\\_\\hspace{0.3mm}photo} \\notag \\\\ &amp;\\qquad\\ + \\beta_3 \\times \\textbf{duration} + \\beta_4 \\times \\textbf{wheels} \\notag \\\\ \\hat{y} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_4 \\label{eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictors}\\end{aligned}\\] In this equation, \\(y\\) represents the total price, \\(x_1\\) indicates whether the game is new, \\(x_2\\) indicates whether a stock photo was used, \\(x_3\\) is the duration of the auction, and \\(x_4\\) is the number of Wii wheels included with the game. Just as with the single predictor case, a multiple regression model may be missing important components or it might not precisely represent the relationship between the outcome and the available explanatory variables. While no model is perfect, we wish to explore the possibility that this one may fit the data reasonably well. We estimate the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), …, \\(\\beta_4\\) in the same way as we did in the case of a single predictor. We select \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), …, \\(b_4\\) that minimize the sum of the squared residuals: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{sumOfSqResInMultRegr} SSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_{141}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{141} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{141} \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\] Here there are 141 residuals, one for each observation. We typically use a computer to minimize the sum in Equation and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors]. Using this output, we identify the point estimates \\(b_i\\) of each \\(\\beta_i\\), just as we did in the one-predictor case. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std. Error &amp; t value &amp; Pr(\\(&gt;\\)\\(|\\)t\\(|\\)) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; (Intercept) &amp; 36.2110 &amp; 1.5140 &amp; 23.92 &amp; 0.0000 cond_ new &amp; 5.1306 &amp; 1.0511 &amp; 4.88 &amp; 0.0000 stock_ photo &amp; 1.0803 &amp; 1.0568 &amp; 1.02 &amp; 0.3085 duration &amp; -0.0268 &amp; 0.1904 &amp; -0.14 &amp; 0.8882 wheels &amp; 7.2852 &amp; 0.5547 &amp; 13.13 &amp; 0.0000 &amp;&amp;&amp; [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors] A multiple regression model is a linear model with many predictors. In general, we write the model as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_k %+ \\epsilon\\end{aligned}\\] when there are \\(k\\) predictors. We often estimate the \\(\\beta_i\\) parameters using a computer. [eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictorsWithCoefficients] Write out the model in Equation using the point estimates from Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors]. How many predictors are there in this model?4 What does \\(\\beta_4\\), the coefficient of variable \\(x_4\\) (Wii wheels), represent? What is the point estimate of \\(\\beta_4\\)?5 [computeMultipleRegressionResidualForMarioKart] Compute the residual of the first observation in Table using the equation identified in Guided Practice [eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictorsWithCoefficients].6 We estimated a coefficient for in Section [twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData] of \\(b_1 = 10.90\\) with a standard error of \\(SE_{b_1} = 1.26\\) when using simple linear regression. Why might there be a difference between that estimate and the one in the multiple regression setting? [colinearityOfCondNewAndStockPhoto] If we examined the data carefully, we would see that some predictors are correlated. For instance, when we estimated the connection of the outcome price and predictor using simple linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like the number of Wii wheels included in the auction. That model was biased by the confounding variable wheels. When we use both variables, this particular underlying and unintentional bias is reduced or eliminated (though bias from other confounding variables may still remain). Example [colinearityOfCondNewAndStockPhoto] describes a common issue in multiple regression: correlation among predictor variables. We say the two predictor variables are collinear (pronounced as co-linear) when they are correlated, and this collinearity complicates model estimation. While it is impossible to prevent collinearity from arising in observational data, experiments are usually designed to prevent predictors from being collinear. The estimated value of the intercept is 36.21, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model’s predicted price when each of the variables take value zero: the game is used, the primary image is not a stock photo, the auction duration is zero days, and there are no wheels included. Is there any value gained by making this interpretation?7 11.1.3 Adjusted \\(R^2\\) as a better estimate of explained variance We first used \\(R^2\\) in Section [fittingALineByLSR] to determine the amount of variability in the response that was explained by the model: \\[\\begin{aligned} R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{variability in residuals}}{\\text{variability in the outcome}} = 1 - \\frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(e_i\\) represents the residuals of the model and \\(y_i\\) the outcomes. This equation remains valid in the multiple regression framework, but a small enhancement can often be even more informative. [computeUnadjustedR2ForAllPredictorsInMarioKart] The variance of the residuals for the model given in Guided Practice [computeMultipleRegressionResidualForMarioKart] is 23.34, and the variance of the total price in all the auctions is 83.06. Calculate \\(R^2\\) for this model.8 This strategy for estimating \\(R^2\\) is acceptable when there is just a single variable. However, it becomes less helpful when there are many variables. The regular \\(R^2\\) is actually a biased estimate of the amount of variability explained by the model. To get a better estimate, we use the adjusted \\(R^2\\). The is computed as \\[\\begin{aligned} R_{adj}^{2} = 1-\\frac{Var(e_i) / (n-k-1)}{Var(y_i) / (n-1)} = 1-\\frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)} \\times \\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of cases used to fit the model and \\(k\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model. Because \\(k\\) is never negative, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) will be smaller – often times just a little smaller – than the unadjusted \\(R^2\\). The reasoning behind the adjusted \\(R^2\\) lies in the associated with each variance.9 There were \\(n=141\\) auctions in the data set and \\(k=4\\) predictor variables in the model. Use \\(n\\), \\(k\\), and the variances from Guided Practice [computeUnadjustedR2ForAllPredictorsInMarioKart] to calculate \\(R_{adj}^2\\) for the Mario Kart model.10 Suppose you added another predictor to the model, but the variance of the errors \\(Var(e_i)\\) didn’t go down. What would happen to the \\(R^2\\)? What would happen to the adjusted \\(R^2\\)? 11 11.2 Model selection The best model is not always the most complicated. Sometimes including variables that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions. In this section we discuss model selection strategies, which will help us eliminate from the model variables that are less important. In this section, and in practice, the model that includes all available explanatory variables is often referred to as the full model. Our goal is to assess whether the full model is the best model. If it isn’t, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable. 11.2.1 Identifying variables in the model that may not be helpful Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors2] provides a summary of the regression output for the full model for the auction data. The last column of the table lists p-values that can be used to assess hypotheses of the following form: \\(\\beta_i = 0\\) when the other explanatory variables are included in the model. \\(\\beta_i \\neq 0\\) when the other explanatory variables are included in the model. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std. Error &amp; t value &amp; Pr(\\(&gt;\\)\\(|\\)t\\(|\\)) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; (Intercept) &amp; 36.2110 &amp; 1.5140 &amp; 23.92 &amp; 0.0000 cond_ new &amp; 5.1306 &amp; 1.0511 &amp; 4.88 &amp; 0.0000 stock_ photo &amp; 1.0803 &amp; 1.0568 &amp; 1.02 &amp; 0.3085 duration &amp; -0.0268 &amp; 0.1904 &amp; -0.14 &amp; 0.8882 wheels &amp; 7.2852 &amp; 0.5547 &amp; 13.13 &amp; 0.0000 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors2] The coefficient of has a \\(t\\) test statistic of \\(T=4.88\\) and a p-value for its corresponding hypotheses (\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\), \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\)) of about zero. How can this be interpreted? If we keep all the other variables in the model and add no others, then there is strong evidence that a game’s condition (new or used) has a real relationship with the total auction price. Is there strong evidence that using a stock photo is related to the total auction price? The \\(t\\) test statistic for is \\(T=1.02\\) and the p-value is about 0.31. After accounting for the other predictors, there is not strong evidence that using a stock photo in an auction is related to the total price of the auction. We might consider removing the variable from the model. Identify the p-values for both the duration and wheels variables in the model. Is there strong evidence supporting the connection of these variables with the total price in the model?12 There is not statistically significant evidence that either the stock photo or duration variables contribute meaningfully to the model. Next we consider common strategies for pruning such variables from a model. The adjusted \\(R^2\\) may be used as an alternative to p-values for model selection, where a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) represents a better model fit. For instance, we could compare two models using their adjusted \\(R^2\\), and the model with the higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) would be preferred. This approach tends to include more variables in the final model when compared to the p-value approach. 11.2.2 Two model selection strategies Two common strategies for adding or removing variables in a multiple regression model are called backward-selection and forward-selection. These techniques are often referred to as stepwise model selection strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they “step” through the candidate predictors. We will discuss these strategies in the context of the p-value approach. Alternatively, we could have employed an \\(R_{adj}^2\\) approach. The backward-elimination strategy starts with the model that includes all potential predictor variables. Variables are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until only variables with statistically significant p-values remain. The strategy within each elimination step is to drop the variable with the largest p-value, refit the model, and reassess the inclusion of all variables. Results corresponding to the full model for the data are shown in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors2]. How should we proceed under the backward-elimination strategy? [backwardEliminationExampleWMarioKartData] There are two variables with coefficients that are not statistically different from zero: and duration. We first drop the duration variable since it has a larger corresponding p-value, then we refit the model. A regression summary for the new model is shown in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictorsButDuration]. In the new model, there is not strong evidence that the coefficient for is different from zero, even though the p-value decreased slightly, and the other p-values remain very small. Next, we again eliminate the variable with the largest non-significant p-value, , and refit the model. The updated regression summary is shown in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictorsButDurationAndStockPhoto]. In the latest model, we see that the two remaining predictors have statistically significant coefficients with p-values of about zero. Since there are no variables remaining that could be eliminated from the model, we stop. The final model includes only the and wheels variables in predicting the total auction price: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{y} \\ &amp;= \\ b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_4x_4 \\\\ &amp;= \\ 36.78 + 5.58x_1 + 7.23x_4\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(x_1\\) represents and \\(x_4\\) represents wheels. An alternative to using p-values in model selection is to use the adjusted \\(R^2\\). At each elimination step, we refit the model without each of the variables up for potential elimination. For example, in the first step, we would fit four models, where each would be missing a different predictor. If one of these smaller models has a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) than our current model, we pick the smaller model with the largest adjusted \\(R^2\\). We continue in this way until removing variables does not increase \\(R_{adj}^2\\). Had we used the adjusted \\(R^2\\) criteria, we would have kept the variable along with the and wheels variables. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std.

It is common for p-values of one variable to change, due to collinearity, after eliminating a different variable. This fluctuation emphasizes the importance of refitting a model after each variable elimination step. The p-values tend to change dramatically when the eliminated variable is highly correlated with another variable in the model. The forward-selection strategy is the reverse of the backward-elimination technique. Instead of eliminating variables one-at-a-time, we add variables one-at-a-time until we cannot find any variables that present strong evidence of their importance in the model. Construct a model for the data set using the forward-selection strategy.[forwardEliminationExampleWMarioKartData] We start with the model that includes no variables. Then we fit each of the possible models with just one variable. That is, we fit the model including just the predictor, then the model including just the variable, then a model with just duration, and a model with just wheels. Each of the four models (yes, we fit four models!) provides a p-value for the coefficient of the predictor variable. Out of these four variables, the wheels variable had the smallest p-value. Since its p-value is less than 0.05 (the p-value was smaller than 2e-16), we add the Wii wheels variable to the model. Once a variable is added in forward-selection, it will be included in all models considered as well as the final model. Since we successfully found a first variable to add, we consider adding another. We fit three new models: (1) the model including just the and wheels variables (output in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictorsButDurationAndStockPhoto]), (2) the model including just the and wheels variables, and (3) the model including only the duration and wheels variables. Of these models, the first had the lowest p-value for its new variable (the p-value corresponding to was 1.4e-08). Because this p-value is below 0.05, we add the variable to the model. Now the final model is guaranteed to include both the condition and wheels variables. We must then repeat the process a third time, fitting two new models: (1) the model including the , , and wheels variables (output in Table [outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictorsButDuration]) and (2) the model including the duration, , and wheels variables. The p-value corresponding to in the first model (0.275) was smaller than the p-value corresponding to duration in the second model (0.682). However, since this smaller p-value was not below 0.05, there was not strong evidence that it should be included in the model. Therefore, neither variable is added and we are finished. The final model is the same as that arrived at using the backward-selection strategy. As before, we could have used the \\(R_{adj}^2\\) criteria instead of examining p-values in selecting variables for the model. Rather than look for variables with the smallest p-value, we look for the model with the largest \\(R_{adj}^2\\). What would the result of forward-selection be using the adjusted \\(R^2\\) approach? Using the forward-selection strategy, we start with the model with no predictors. Next we look at each model with a single predictor. If one of these models has a larger \\(R_{adj}^2\\) than the model with no variables, we use this new model. We repeat this procedure, adding one variable at a time, until we cannot find a model with a larger \\(R_{adj}^2\\). If we had done the forward-selection strategy using \\(R_{adj}^2\\), we would have arrived at the model including , , and wheels, which is a slightly larger model than we arrived at using the p-value approach and the same model we arrived at using the adjusted \\(R^2\\) and backwards-elimination. The backward-elimination strategy begins with the largest model and eliminates variables one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining variables are important to the model. The forward-selection strategy starts with no variables included in the model, then it adds in variables according to their importance until no other important variables are found. There is no guarantee that the backward-elimination and forward-selection strategies will arrive at the same final model using the p-value or adjusted \\(R^2\\) methods. If the backwards-elimination and forward-selection strategies are both tried and they arrive at different models, choose the model with the larger \\(R_{adj}^2\\) as a tie-breaker; other tie-break options exist but are beyond the scope of this book. It is generally acceptable to use just one strategy, usually backward-elimination with either the p-value or adjusted \\(R^2\\) criteria. However, before reporting the model results, we must verify the model conditions are reasonable. 11.3 Checking model assumptions using graphs Multiple regression methods using the model \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{y} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_kx_k\\end{aligned}\\] generally depend on the following four assumptions: the residuals of the model are nearly normal, the variability of the residuals is nearly constant, the residuals are independent, and each variable is linearly related to the outcome. Simple and effective plots can be used to check each of these assumptions. We will consider the model for the auction data that uses the game condition and number of wheels as predictors. The plotting methods presented here may also be used to check the conditions for the models introduced in Chapter [linRegrForTwoVar]. Normal probability plot. A normal probability plot of the residuals is shown in Figure [mkDiagnosticNormalQuantilePlot]. While the plot exhibits some minor irregularities, there are no outliers that might be cause for concern. In a normal probability plot for residuals, we tend to be most worried about residuals that appear to be outliers, since these indicate long tails in the distribution of residuals. A normal probability plot of the residuals is helpful in identifying observations that might be outliers. [mkDiagnosticNormalQuantilePlot] Absolute values of residuals against fitted values. A plot of the absolute value of the residuals against their corresponding fitted values (\\(\\hat{y}_i\\)) is shown in Figure [mkDiagnosticEvsAbsF]. This plot is helpful to check the condition that the variance of the residuals is approximately constant. We don’t see any obvious deviations from constant variance in this example. Comparing the absolute value of the residuals against the fitted values (\\(\\hat{y}_i\\)) is helpful in identifying deviations from the constant variance assumption. [mkDiagnosticEvsAbsF] Residuals in order of their data collection. A plot of the residuals in the order their corresponding auctions were observed is shown in Figure [mkDiagnosticInOrder]. Such a plot is helpful in identifying any connection between cases that are close to one another, e.g. we could look for declining prices over time or if there was a time of the day when auctions tended to fetch a higher price. Here we see no structure that indicates a problem.13 Plotting residuals in the order that their corresponding observations were collected helps identify connections between successive observations. If it seems that consecutive observations tend to be close to each other, this indicates the independence assumption of the observations would fail. [mkDiagnosticInOrder] Residuals against each predictor variable. We consider a plot of the residuals against the variable and the residuals against the wheels variable. These plots are shown in Figure [mkDiagnosticEvsVariables]. For the two-level condition variable, we are guaranteed not to see any remaining trend, and instead we are checking that the variability doesn’t fluctuate across groups. In this example, when we consider the residuals against the wheels variable, we see some possible structure. There appears to be curvature in the residuals, indicating the relationship is probably not linear. In the two-level variable for the game’s condition, we check for differences in distribution shape or variability. For numerical predictors, we also check for trends or other structure. We see some slight bowing in the residuals against the wheels variable. [mkDiagnosticEvsVariables] It is necessary to summarize diagnostics for any model fit. If the diagnostics support the model assumptions, this would improve credibility in the findings. If the diagnostic assessment shows remaining underlying structure in the residuals, we should try to adjust the model to account for that structure. If we are unable to do so, we may still report the model but must also note its shortcomings. In the case of the auction data, we report that there may be a nonlinear relationship between the total price and the number of wheels included for an auction. This information would be important to buyers and sellers; omitting this information could be a setback to the very people who the model might assist. The truth is that no model is perfect. However, even imperfect models can be useful. Reporting a flawed model can be reasonable so long as we are clear and report the model’s shortcomings. Don’t report results when assumptions are grossly violated While there is a little leeway in model assumptions, don’t go too far. If model assumptions are very clearly violated, consider a new model, even if it means learning more statistical methods or hiring someone who can help. Confidence intervals for coefficients in multiple regression can be computed using the same formula as in the single predictor model: \\[\\begin{aligned} b_i \\ \\pm\\ t_{df}^{\\star}SE_{b_{i}}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(t_{df}^{\\star}\\) is the appropriate \\(t\\) value corresponding to the confidence level and model degrees of freedom, \\(df=n-k-1\\). 11.4 Logistic regression In this section we introduce logistic regression as a tool for building models when there is a categorical response variable with two levels. Logistic regression is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) for response variables where regular multiple regression does not work very well. In particular, the response variable in these settings often takes a form where residuals look completely different from the normal distribution. GLMs can be thought of as a two-stage modeling approach. We first model the response variable using a probability distribution, such as the binomial or Poisson distribution. Second, we model the parameter of the distribution using a collection of predictors and a special form of multiple regression. In Section [logisticRegression] we will revisit the email data set from Chapter [introductionToData]. These emails were collected from a single email account, and we will work on developing a basic spam filter using these data. The response variable, spam, has been encoded to take value 0 when a message is not spam and 1 when it is spam. Our task will be to build an appropriate model that classifies messages as spam or not spam using email characteristics coded as predictor variables. While this model will not be the same as those used in large-scale spam filters, it shares many of the same features. 11.4.1 Email data The email data set was first presented in Chapter [introductionToData] with a relatively small number of variables. In fact, there are many more variables available that might be useful for classifying spam. Descriptions of these variables are presented in Table [emailVariables]. The spam variable will be the outcome, and the other 10 variables will be the model predictors. While we have limited the predictors used in this section to be categorical variables (where many are represented as indicator variables), numerical predictors may also be used in logistic regression. See the footnote for an additional discussion on this topic.14 Descriptions for 11 variables in the email data set. Notice that all of the variables are indicator variables, which take the value 1 if the specified characteristic is present and 0 otherwise. variable description spam Specifies whether the message was spam. An indicator variable for if more than one person was listed in the To field of the email. cc An indicator for if someone was CCed on the email. attach An indicator for if there was an attachment, such as a document or image. dollar An indicator for if the word “dollar” or dollar symbol ($) appeared in the email. winner An indicator for if the word “winner” appeared in the email message. inherit An indicator for if the word “inherit” (or a variation, like “inheritance”) appeared in the email. password An indicator for if the word “password” was present in the email. format Indicates if the email contained special formatting, such as bolding, tables, or links Indicates whether “Re:” was included at the start of the email subject. Indicates whether any exclamation point was included in the email subject. [emailVariables] 11.4.2 Modeling the probability of an event The outcome variable for a GLM is denoted by \\(Y_i\\), where the index \\(i\\) is used to represent observation \\(i\\). In the email application, \\(Y_i\\) will be used to represent whether email \\(i\\) is spam (\\(Y_i=1\\)) or not (\\(Y_i=0\\)). The predictor variables are represented as follows: \\(x_{1,i}\\) is the value of variable 1 for observation \\(i\\), \\(x_{2,i}\\) is the value of variable 2 for observation \\(i\\), and so on. Logistic regression is a generalized linear model where the outcome is a two-level categorical variable. The outcome, \\(Y_i\\), takes the value 1 (in our application, this represents a spam message) with probability \\(p_i\\) and the value 0 with probability \\(1-p_i\\). It is the probability \\(p_i\\) that we model in relation to the predictor variables. The logistic regression model relates the probability an email is spam (\\(p_i\\)) to the predictors \\(x_{1,i}\\), \\(x_{2,i}\\), …, \\(x_{k,i}\\) through a framework much like that of multiple regression: \\[\\begin{aligned} transformation(p_{i}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\cdots \\beta_k x_{k,i} \\label{linkTransformationEquation}\\end{aligned}\\] We want to choose a transformation in Equation that makes practical and mathematical sense. For example, we want a transformation that makes the range of possibilities on the left hand side of Equation equal to the range of possibilities for the right hand side; if there was no transformation for this equation, the left hand side could only take values between 0 and 1, but the right hand side could take values outside of this range. A common transformation for \\(p_i\\) is the logit transformation, which may be written as \\[\\begin{aligned} logit(p_i) = \\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right)\\end{aligned}\\] The logit transformation is shown in Figure [logitTransformationFigureHoriz]. Below, we rewrite Equation using the logit transformation of \\(p_i\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} \\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}\\end{aligned}\\] In our spam example, there are 10 predictor variables, so \\(k = 10\\). This model isn’t very intuitive, but it still has some resemblance to multiple regression, and we can fit this model using software. In fact, once we look at results from software, it will start to feel like we’re back in multiple regression, even if the interpretation of the coefficients is more complex. Values of \\(p_i\\) against values of \\(logit(p_i)\\). [logitTransformationFigureHoriz] Here we create a spam filter with a single predictor: . This variable indicates whether more than one email address was listed in the To field of the email. The following logistic regression model was fit using statistical software: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\log\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) = -2.12 - 1.81\\times\\text{\\textbf{to\\_\\hspace{0.3mm}multiple}}\\end{aligned}\\] If an email is randomly selected and it has just one address in the To field, what is the probability it is spam? What if more than one address is listed in the To field? [logisticExampleWithToMultiple] If there is only one email in the To field, then takes value 0 and the right side of the model equation equals -2.12. Solving for \\(p_i\\): \\(\\frac{e^{-2.12}}{1 + e^{-2.12}} = 0.11\\). Just as we labeled a fitted value of \\(y_i\\) with a “hat” in single-variable and multiple regression, we will do the same for this probability: \\(\\hat{p}_i = 0.11\\). If there is more than one address listed in the To field, then the right side of the model equation is \\(-2.12 - 1.81\\times1 = -3.93\\), which corresponds to a probability \\(\\hat{p}_i = 0.02\\). Notice that we could examine -2.12 and -3.93 in Figure [logitTransformationFigureHoriz] to estimate the probability before formally calculating the value. To convert from values on the regression-scale (e.g. -2.12 and -3.93 in Example [logisticExampleWithToMultiple]), use the following formula, which is the result of solving for \\(p_i\\) in the regression model: \\[\\begin{aligned} p_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}+\\cdots+\\beta_k x_{k,i}}} {\\ 1\\ \\ +\\ \\ e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}+\\cdots+\\beta_k x_{k,i}}\\ }\\end{aligned}\\] As with most applied data problems, we substitute the point estimates for the parameters (the \\(\\beta_i\\)) so that we may make use of this formula. In Example [logisticExampleWithToMultiple], the probabilities were calculated as \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\frac{\\ e^{-2.12}\\ }{\\ 1\\ +\\ e^{-2.12}\\ } = 0.11 &amp;&amp; \\frac{\\ e^{-2.12 - 1.81}\\ }{\\ 1\\ +\\ e^{-2.12 - 1.81}\\ } = 0.02\\end{aligned}\\] While the information about whether the email is addressed to multiple people is a helpful start in classifying email as spam or not, the probabilities of 11% and 2% are not dramatically different, and neither provides very strong evidence about which particular email messages are spam. To get more precise estimates, we’ll need to include many more variables in the model. We used statistical software to fit the logistic regression model with all ten predictors described in Table [emailVariables]. Like multiple regression, the result may be presented in a summary table, which is shown in Table [emailLogisticModelResults]. The structure of this table is almost identical to that of multiple regression; the only notable difference is that the p-values are calculated using the normal distribution rather than the \\(t\\) distribution. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std.

Using backwards elimination with a p-value cutoff of 0.05 (start with the full model and trim the predictors with p-values greater than 0.05), we ultimately eliminate the , dollar, inherit, and cc predictors. The remainder of this section will rely on this smaller model, which is summarized in Table [emailLogisticReducedModel]. rrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Estimate &amp; Std.

Is the point estimate the same as we found before, -1.81, or is it different? Explain why this might be.15 Point estimates will generally change a little – and sometimes a lot – depending on which other variables are included in the model. This is usually due to colinearity in the predictor variables. We previously saw this in the Ebay auction example when we compared the coefficient of in a single-variable model and the corresponding coefficient in the multiple regression model that used three additional variables (see Sections [twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData] and [includingAndAssessingManyVariablesInAModel]). Spam filters are built to be automated, meaning a piece of software is written to collect information about emails as they arrive, and this information is put in the form of variables. These variables are then put into an algorithm that uses a statistical model, like the one we’ve fit, to classify the email. Suppose we write software for a spam filter using the reduced model shown in Table [emailLogisticReducedModel]. If an incoming email has the word “winner” in it, will this raise or lower the model’s calculated probability that the incoming email is spam? [exampleForSpamAndWinner] The estimated coefficient of winner is positive (1.7370). A positive coefficient estimate in logistic regression, just like in multiple regression, corresponds to a positive association between the predictor and response variables when accounting for the other variables in the model. Since the response variable takes value 1 if an email is spam and 0 otherwise, the positive coefficient indicates that the presence of “winner” in an email raises the model probability that the message is spam. Suppose the same email from Example [exampleForSpamAndWinner] was in HTML format, meaning the format variable took value 1. Does this characteristic increase or decrease the probability that the email is spam according to the model?[exampleForSpamAndFormat] Since HTML corresponds to a value of 1 in the format variable and the coefficient of this variable is negative (-1.5569), this would lower the probability estimate returned from the model. 11.4.3 Practical decisions in the email application Examples [exampleForSpamAndWinner] and [exampleForSpamAndFormat] highlight a key feature of logistic and multiple regression. In the spam filter example, some email characteristics will push an email’s classification in the direction of spam while other characteristics will push it in the opposite direction. If we were to implement a spam filter using the model we have fit, then each future email we analyze would fall into one of three categories based on the email’s characteristics: The email characteristics generally indicate the email is not spam, and so the resulting probability that the email is spam is quite low, say, under 0.05. The characteristics generally indicate the email is spam, and so the resulting probability that the email is spam is quite large, say, over 0.95. The characteristics roughly balance each other out in terms of evidence for and against the message being classified as spam. Its probability falls in the remaining range, meaning the email cannot be adequately classified as spam or not spam. If we were managing an email service, we would have to think about what should be done in each of these three instances. In an email application, there are usually just two possibilities: filter the email out from the regular inbox and put it in a “spambox”, or let the email go to the regular inbox. The first and second scenarios are intuitive. If the evidence strongly suggests a message is not spam, send it to the inbox. If the evidence strongly suggests the message is spam, send it to the spambox. How should we handle emails in the third category?16 Suppose we apply the logistic model we have built as a spam filter and that 100 messages are placed in the spambox over 3 months. If we used the guidelines above for putting messages into the spambox, about how many legitimate (non-spam) messages would you expect to find among the 100 messages?17 Almost any classifier will have some error. In the spam filter guidelines above, we have decided that it is okay to allow up to 5% of the messages in the spambox to be real messages. If we wanted to make it a little harder to classify messages as spam, we could use a cutoff of 0.99. This would have two effects. Because it raises the standard for what can be classified as spam, it reduces the number of good emails that are classified as spam. However, it will also fail to correctly classify an increased fraction of spam messages. No matter the complexity and the confidence we might have in our model, these practical considerations are absolutely crucial to making a helpful spam filter. Without them, we could actually do more harm than good by using our statistical model. 11.4.4 Diagnostics for the email classifier There are two key conditions for fitting a logistic regression model: Each predictor \\(x_i\\) is linearly related to logit\\((p_i)\\) if all other predictors are held constant. Each outcome \\(Y_i\\) is independent of the other outcomes. The first condition of the logistic regression model is not easily checked without a fairly sizable amount of data. Luckily, we have 3,921 emails in our data set! Let’s first visualize these data by plotting the true classification of the emails against the model’s fitted probabilities, as shown in Figure [logisticModelPredict]. The vast majority of emails (spam or not) still have fitted probabilities below 0.5. The predicted probability that each of the 3,912 emails is spam is classified by their grouping, spam or not. Noise (small, random vertical shifts) have been added to each point so that points with nearly identical values aren’t plotted exactly on top of one another. This makes it possible to see more observations. [logisticModelPredict] This may at first seem very discouraging: we have fit a logistic model to create a spam filter, but no emails have a fitted probability of being spam above 0.75. Don’t despair; we will discuss ways to improve the model through the use of better variables in Section [improvingTheSetOfVariablesForASpamFilter]. We’d like to assess the quality of our model. For example, we might ask: if we look at emails that we modeled as having a 10% chance of being spam, do we find about 10% of them actually are spam? To help us out, we’ll borrow an advanced statistical method called natural splines that estimates the local probability over the region 0.00 to 0.75 (the largest predicted probability was 0.73, so we avoid extrapolating). All you need to know about natural splines to understand what we are doing is that they are used to fit flexible lines rather than straight lines. The curve fit using natural splines is shown in Figure [logisticModelSpline] as a solid black line. If the logistic model fits well, the curve should closely follow the dashed \\(y=x\\) line. We have added shading to represent the confidence bound for the curved line to clarify what fluctuations might plausibly be due to chance. Even with this confidence bound, there are weaknesses in the first model assumption. The solid curve and its confidence bound dips below the dashed line from about 0.1 to 0.3, and then it drifts above the dashed line from about 0.35 to 0.55. These deviations indicate the model relating the parameter to the predictors does not closely resemble the true relationship. The solid black line provides the empirical estimate of the probability for observations based on their predicted probabilities (confidence bounds are also shown for this line), which is fit using natural splines. A small amount of noise was added to the observations in the plot to allow more observations to be seen. [logisticModelSpline] We could evaluate the second logistic regression model assumption – independence of the outcomes – using the model residuals. The residuals for a logistic regression model are calculated the same way as with multiple regression: the observed outcome minus the expected outcome. For logistic regression, the expected value of the outcome is the fitted probability for the observation, and the residual may be written as \\[\\begin{aligned} e_i = Y_i - \\hat{p}_i\\end{aligned}\\] We could plot these residuals against a variety of variables or in their order of collection, as we did with the residuals in multiple regression. However, since the model will need to be revised to effectively classify spam and you have already seen similar residual plots in Section [multipleRegressionModelAssumptions], we won’t investigate the residuals here. 11.4.5 Improving the set of variables for a spam filter If we were building a spam filter for an email service that managed many accounts (e.g. Gmail or Hotmail), we would spend much more time thinking about additional variables that could be useful in classifying emails as spam or not. We also would use transformations or other techniques that would help us include strongly skewed numerical variables as predictors. Take a few minutes to think about additional variables that might be useful in identifying spam. Below is a list of variables we think might be useful: An indicator variable could be used to represent whether there was prior two-way correspondence with a message’s sender. For instance, if you sent a message to john@example.com and then John sent you an email, this variable would take value 1 for the email that John sent. If you had never sent John an email, then the variable would be set to 0. A second indicator variable could utilize an account’s past spam flagging information. The variable could take value 1 if the sender of the message has previously sent messages flagged as spam. A third indicator variable could flag emails that contain links included in previous spam messages. If such a link is found, then set the variable to 1 for the email. Otherwise, set it to 0. The variables described above take one of two approaches. Variable (1) is specially designed to capitalize on the fact that spam is rarely sent between individuals that have two-way communication. Variables (2) and (3) are specially designed to flag common spammers or spam messages. While we would have to verify using the data that each of the variables is effective, these seem like promising ideas. Table [emailTableOfSpamAnd] shows a contingency table for spam and also for the new variable described in (1) above. If we look at the 1,090 emails where there was correspondence with the sender in the preceding 30 days, not one of these message was spam. This suggests variable (1) would be very effective at accurately classifying some messages as not spam. With this single variable, we would be able to send about 28% of messages through to the inbox with confidence that almost none are spam. lrrrr &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;&amp; Total &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 367 &amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 367 &amp; 2464 &amp; 1090 &amp;&amp; 3554 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Total &amp; 2831 &amp; 1090 &amp;&amp; 3921 [emailTableOfSpamAnd] The variables described in (2) and (3) would provide an excellent foundation for distinguishing messages coming from known spammers or messages that take a known form of spam. To utilize these variables, we would need to build databases: one holding email addresses of known spammers, and one holding URLs found in known spam messages. Our access to such information is limited, so we cannot implement these two variables in this textbook. However, if we were hired by an email service to build a spam filter, these would be important next steps. In addition to finding more and better predictors, we would need to create a customized logistic regression model for each email account. This may sound like an intimidating task, but its complexity is not as daunting as it may at first seem. We’ll save the details for a statistics course where computer programming plays a more central role. For what is the extremely challenging task of classifying spam messages, we have made a lot of progress. We have seen that simple email variables, such as the format, inclusion of certain words, and other circumstantial characteristics, provide helpful information for spam classification. Many challenges remain, from better understanding logistic regression to carrying out the necessary computer programming, but completing such a task is very nearly within your reach.

We’ll continue working with the normal model in the context of inference for proportions, and we’ll also encounter a new technique and distribution suitable for working with frequency and contingency tables in Sections [oneWayChiSquare] and [twoWayTablesAndChiSquare]. 12.1 Inference for a single proportion Before we get started, we’ll introduce a little terminology and notation. In the tappers-listeners study, one person tapped a tune on the table and the listener tried to guess the game. In this study, each game can be thought of as a trial. We could label each trial a success if the listener successfully guessed the tune, and we could label a trial a failure if the listener was unsuccessful. A single event that leads to an outcome can be called a trial. If the trial has two possible outcomes, e.g. heads or tails when flipping a coin, we typically label one of those outcome a success and the other a failure. The choice of which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure is arbitrary, and it will not impact the results of our analyses. When a proportion is recorded, it is common to use a 1 to represent a “success” and a 0 to represent a “failure” and then write down a key to communicate what each value represents. This notation is also convenient for calculations. For example, if we have 10 trials with 6 success (1’s) and 4 failures (0’s), the sample proportion can be computed using the mean of the zeros and ones: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0\\ }{10} = 0.6\\end{aligned}\\] Next we’ll take a look at when we can apply our normal distribution framework to the distribution of the sample proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\). 12.1.1 When the sample proportion is nearly normal The sampling distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\), taken from a sample of size \\(n\\) from a population with a true proportion \\(p\\), is nearly normal when the sample observations are independent and we expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our sample, i.e. \\(np\\geq10\\) and \\(n(1-p)\\geq10\\). This is called the success-failure condition. If these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal with mean \\(p\\) and standard error \\[\\begin{aligned} SE_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ p(1-p)\\ }{n}} \\label{seOfPHat}\\end{aligned}\\] [ \\(\\hat{p}\\) sample proportion \\(p\\) population proportion] \\(\\hat{p}\\) sample proportion \\(p\\) population proportion Typically we do not know the true proportion, \\(p\\), so we substitute some value to check conditions and to estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, usually \\(\\hat{p}\\) is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value \\(p_0\\) is used in place of \\(p\\). Examples are presented for each of these cases in Sections [confIntForPropSection] and [htForPropSection]. If data come from a simple random sample and consist of less than 10% of the population, then the independence assumption is reasonable. Or, for example, if the data come from an experiment where each user was randomly assigned to the treatment or control group and users do not interact, then the observations in each group are typically independent. 12.1.2 Confidence intervals for a proportion According to a New York Times / CBS News poll in June 2012, only about 44% of the American public approves of the job the Supreme Court is doing.18 This poll included responses of 976 randomly sampled adults. We want a confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Our point estimate, based on a simple random sample of size \\(n = 976\\) from the NYTimes/CBS poll, is \\(\\hat{p} = 0.44\\). To use our confidence interval formula from Section [ConfidenceIntervals], we must first check whether the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal and calculate the standard error of the estimate. The data are based on a simple random sample and consist of far fewer than 10% of the U.S. population, so independence is confirmed. The sample size must also be sufficiently large, which is checked via the success-failure condition: there were approximately \\(976\\times \\hat{p}=429\\) “successes” and \\(976\\times (1-\\hat{p})=547\\) “failures” in the sample, both easily greater than 10. With the conditions met, we are assured that the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal. Next, a standard error for \\(\\hat{p}\\) is needed, and then we can employ the usual method to construct a confidence interval. [seOfPropOfAmericansJobApprovalOfSupremeCourt] Estimate the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}=0.44\\) using Equation . Because \\(p\\) is unknown and the standard error is for a confidence interval, use \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\). 19 Construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\), the proportion of Americans who approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Using the standard error estimate from Guided Practice [seOfPropOfAmericansJobApprovalOfSupremeCourt], the point estimate 0.44, and \\(z^{\\star} = 1.96\\) for a 95% confidence interval, the confidence interval can be computed as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{point estimate } \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star}SE \\quad\\to\\quad 0.44 \\ \\pm\\ 1.96\\times 0.016 \\quad\\to\\quad (0.409, 0.471)\\end{aligned}\\] We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Americans who approve of the job of the Supreme Court (in June 2012) is between 0.409 and 0.471. At the time this poll was taken, we can say with high confidence that the job approval of the Supreme Court was below 50%. Verify the observations are independent and also verify the success-failure condition using \\(\\hat{p}\\) and \\(n\\). If the conditions are met, then the Central Limit Theorem applies, and the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is well-approximated by the normal model. Construct the standard error using \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\) and apply the general confidence interval formula. 12.1.3 Hypothesis testing for a proportion To apply the same normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must also be satisfied. However, in a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify \\(np_0\\) and \\(n(1-p_0)\\) are at least 10, where \\(p_0\\) is the null value. Deborah Toohey is running for Congress, and her campaign manager claims she has more than 50% support from the district’s electorate. Ms. Toohey’s opponent claimed that Ms. Toohey has less than 50%. Set up a hypothesis test to evaluate who is right.20 A newspaper collects a simple random sample of 500 likely voters in the district and estimates Toohey’s support to be 52%. Does this provide convincing evidence for the claim of Toohey’s manager at the 5% significance level? [TooheyInferenceExample] Because this is a simple random sample that includes fewer than 10% of the population, the observations are independent. In a one-proportion hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion, \\(p_0=0.5\\): \\(np_0 = n(1-p_0) = 500\\times 0.5 = 250 &gt; 10\\). With these conditions verified, the normal model may be applied to \\(\\hat{p}\\). Next the standard error can be computed. The null value is used again here, because this is a hypothesis test for a single proportion. \\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0\\times (1-p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5\\times (1-0.5)}{500}} = 0.022\\] A picture of the normal model is shown in Figure [pValueForCampaignManagerClaimOfMoreThan50PercentSupport] with the p-value represented by both shaded tails. Based on the normal model, we can compute a test statistic as the Z score of the point estimate: \\[Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{0.52 - 0.50}{0.022} = 0.89\\] The right tail area is 0.1867, and the p-value is \\(2 \\times 0.1867 = 0.3734\\). Because the p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis, and we do not find convincing evidence to support the campaign manager’s claim. Sampling distribution of the sample proportion if the null hypothesis is true for Example [TooheyInferenceExample]. The p-value for the test is shaded. [pValueForCampaignManagerClaimOfMoreThan50PercentSupport] Set up hypotheses and verify the conditions using the null value, \\(p_0\\), to ensure \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal under \\(H_0\\). If the conditions hold, construct the standard error, again using \\(p_0\\), and show the p-value in a drawing. Lastly, compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses. 12.1.4 Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion Frequently statisticians find themselves in a position to not only analyze data, but to help others determine how to most effectively collect data and also how much data should be collected. We can perform sample size calculations that are helpful in planning a study. Our task will be to identify an appropriate sample size that ensures the margin of error \\(ME = z^{\\star} SE\\) will be no larger than some value \\(m\\). For example, we might be asked to find a sample size so the margin of error is no larger than \\(m = 0.04\\), in which case, we write \\[\\begin{aligned} z^{\\star} SE \\leq 0.04\\end{aligned}\\] Generally, we plug in a suitable value for \\(z^{\\star}\\) for the confidence level we plan to use, write in the formula for the standard error, and then solve for the sample size \\(n\\). In the case of a single proportion, we use \\(\\sqrt{p(1-p) / n\\ }\\) for the standard error (\\(SE\\)). If we are conducting a university survey to determine whether students support a $200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium, how big of a sample is needed to ensure the margin of error is less than 0.04 using a 95% confidence level? For a 95% confidence level, the value \\(z^{\\star}\\) corresponds to 1.96, and we can write the margin of error expression as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} ME = z^{\\star}SE = 1.96\\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\leq 0.04\\end{aligned}\\] There are two unknowns in the equation: \\(p\\) and \\(n\\). If we have an estimate of \\(p\\), perhaps from a similar survey, we could use that value. If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for \\(p\\). The margin of error for a proportion is largest when \\(p\\) is 0.5, so we typically use this worst case estimate if no other estimate is available: \\[\\begin{aligned} 1.96\\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} &amp;\\leq 0.04 \\\\ 1.96^2\\times \\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n} &amp;\\leq 0.04^2 \\\\ 1.96^2\\times \\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{0.04^2} &amp;\\leq n \\\\ 600.25 &amp;\\leq n\\end{aligned}\\] We would need at least 600.25 participants, which means we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95% confidence. Notice that in such calculations, we always round up for the sample size! As noted in the example, if we have an estimate of the proportion, we should use it in place of the worst case estimate of the proportion, 0.5. A manager is about to oversee the mass production of a new tire model in her factory, and she would like to estimate what proportion of these tires will be rejected through quality control. The quality control team has monitored the last three tire models produced by the factory, failing 1.7% of tires in the first model, 6.2% of the second model, and 1.3% of the third model. The manager would like to examine enough tires to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model to within about 2% with a 90% confidence level.21 There are three different failure rates to choose from. Perform the sample size computation for each separately, and identify three sample sizes to consider. The sample sizes vary widely. Which of the three would you suggest using? What would influence your choice? A recent estimate of Congress’ approval rating was 17%.22 If we were to conduct a new poll and wanted an estimate with a margin of error smaller than about 0.04 with 95% confidence, how big of a sample should we use?23 12.2 Difference of two proportions We would like to make conclusions about the difference in two population proportions (\\(p_1 - p_2\\)) using the normal model. In this section we consider three such examples. In the first, we compare the approval of the 2010 healthcare law under two different question phrasings. In the second application, a company weighs whether they should switch to a higher quality parts manufacturer. In the last example, we examine the cancer risk to dogs from the use of yard herbicides. In our investigations, we first identify a reasonable point estimate of \\(p_1 - p_2\\) based on the sample. You may have already guessed its form: \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\). Next, in each example we verify that the point estimate follows the normal model by checking certain conditions; as before, these conditions relate to independence of observations and checking for sufficiently large sample size. Finally, we compute the estimate’s standard error and apply our inferential framework. 12.2.1 Sample distribution of the difference of two proportions We must check two conditions before applying the normal model to \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\). First, the sampling distribution for each sample proportion must be nearly normal, and secondly, the samples must be independent. Under these two conditions, the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) may be well approximated using the normal model. The difference \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) tends to follow a normal model when each proportion separately follows a normal model, and the two samples are independent of each other. The standard error of the difference in sample proportions is \\[\\begin{aligned} SE_{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2} = \\sqrt{SE_{\\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\\hat{p}_2}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\label{seForDiffOfProp}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) represent the population proportions, and \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) represent the sample sizes. 12.2.2 Intervals and tests for \\(p_1 -p_2\\) In the setting of confidence intervals, the sample proportions are used to verify the success-failure condition and also compute standard error, just as was the case with a single proportion. The way a question is phrased can influence a person’s response. For example, Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the following question:24 As you may know, by 2014 nearly all Americans will be required to have health insurance. [People who do not buy insurance will pay a penalty] while [People who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the government]. Do you approve or disapprove of this policy? For each randomly sampled respondent, the statements in brackets were randomized: either they were kept in the order given above, or the two statements were reversed. Table [pewPollResultsForRandomizedStatementOrdering] shows the results of this experiment. Create and interpret a 90% confidence interval of the difference in approval. p50mmc p13mmp14mmp16.5mmc &amp; &amp; Sample size (\\(n_i\\)) &amp; Approve law (%) &amp; Disapprove law (%) &amp; Other “people who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the government” is given second &amp; &amp; 771 &amp; 47 &amp; 49 &amp; 3 “people who do not buy it will pay a penalty” is given second &amp; &amp; 732 &amp; 34 &amp; 63 &amp; 3 [pewPollResultsForRandomizedStatementOrdering] First the conditions must be verified. Because each group is a simple random sample from less than 10% of the population, the observations are independent, both within the samples and between the samples. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Because all conditions are met, the normal model can be used for the point estimate of the difference in support, where \\(p_1\\) corresponds to the original ordering and \\(p_2\\) to the reversed ordering: \\[\\hat{p}_{1} - \\hat{p}_{2} = 0.47 - 0.34 = 0.13\\] The standard error may be computed from Equation using the sample proportions: \\[SE \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.47(1-0.47)}{771} + \\frac{0.34(1-0.34)}{732}} = 0.025\\] For a 90% confidence interval, we use \\(z^{\\star} = 1.65\\): \\[\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star}SE \\quad \\to \\quad 0.13 \\ \\pm\\ 1.65 \\times 0.025 \\quad \\to \\quad (0.09, 0.17)\\] We are 90% confident that the approval rating for the 2010 healthcare law changes between 9% and 17% due to the ordering of the two statements in the survey question. The Pew Research Center reported that this modestly large difference suggests that the opinions of much of the public are still fluid on the health insurance mandate. [carWheelGearManufacturer] A remote control car company is considering a new manufacturer for wheel gears. The new manufacturer would be more expensive but their higher quality gears are more reliable, resulting in happier customers and fewer warranty claims. However, management must be convinced that the more expensive gears are worth the conversion before they approve the switch. If there is strong evidence of a more than 3% improvement in the percent of gears that pass inspection, management says they will switch suppliers, otherwise they will maintain the current supplier. Set up appropriate hypotheses for the test.25 The quality control engineer from Guided Practice [carWheelGearManufacturer] collects a sample of gears, examining 1000 gears from each company and finds that 899 gears pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, evaluate the hypothesis setup of Guided Practice [carWheelGearManufacturer] using a significance level of 5%. First, we check the conditions. The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the gears are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, \\(0.958-0.899=0.059\\), can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution. The standard error can be found using Equation : \\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} + \\frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}} = 0.0114\\] In this hypothesis test, the sample proportions were used. We will discuss this choice more in Section [pooledHTForProportionsSection]. Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the p-value, which is depicted in Figure [gearsTwoSampleHTPValueQC]. \\[Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{0.059 - 0.03}{0.0114} = 2.54\\] Using the normal model for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006. Since this is a one-sided test, this single tail area is also the p-value, and we reject the null hypothesis because 0.006 is less than 0.05. That is, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher quality gears actually do pass inspection more than 3% as often as the currently used gears. Based on these results, management will approve the switch to the new supplier. Distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis was true. The p-value is represented by the shaded area. [gearsTwoSampleHTPValueQC] 12.2.3 Hypothesis testing when \\(H_0: p_1=p_2\\) Here we use a new example to examine a special estimate of standard error when \\(H_0: p_1 = p_2\\). We investigate whether there is an increased risk of cancer in dogs that are exposed to the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). A study in 1994 examined 491 dogs that had developed cancer and 945 dogs as a control group.26 Of these two groups, researchers identified which dogs had been exposed to 2,4-D in their owner’s yard. The results are shown in Table [24DAndCancerInDogs]. Summary results for cancer in dogs and the use of 2,4-D by the dog’s owner. cancer no cancer 2,4-D 191 304 no 2,4-D 300 641 [24DAndCancerInDogs] Is this study an experiment or an observational study?27 [htFor24DAndCancerInDogs] Set up hypotheses to test whether 2,4-D and the occurrence of cancer in dogs are related. Use a one-sided test and compare across the cancer and no cancer groups.28 Are the conditions met to use the normal model and make inference on the results?[condFor24DAndCancerInDogsNormalInference] (1) It is unclear whether this is a random sample. However, if we believe the dogs in both the cancer and no cancer groups are representative of each respective population and that the dogs in the study do not interact in any way, then we may find it reasonable to assume independence between observations. (2) The success-failure condition holds for each sample. Under the assumption of independence, we can use the normal model and make statements regarding the canine population based on the data. In your hypotheses for Guided Practice [htFor24DAndCancerInDogs], the null is that the proportion of dogs with exposure to 2,4-D is the same in each group. The point estimate of the difference in sample proportions is \\(\\hat{p}_c - \\hat{p}_n = 0.067\\). To identify the p-value for this test, we first check conditions (Example [condFor24DAndCancerInDogsNormalInference]) and compute the standard error of the difference: \\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{n_c} + \\frac{p_n(1-p_n)}{n_n}}\\] In a hypothesis test, the distribution of the test statistic is always examined as though the null hypothesis is true, i.e. in this case, \\(p_c = p_n\\). The standard error formula should reflect this equality in the null hypothesis. We will use \\(p\\) to represent the common rate of dogs that are exposed to 2,4-D in the two groups: \\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n_c} + \\frac{p(1-p)}{n_n}}\\] We don’t know the exposure rate, \\(p\\), but we can obtain a good estimate of it by pooling the results of both samples: \\[\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\text{\\# of ``successes&#39;&#39;}}{\\text{\\# of cases}} = \\frac{191 + 304}{191+300+304+641} = 0.345\\] This is called the pooled estimate of the sample proportion, and we use it to compute the standard error when the null hypothesis is that \\(p_1 = p_2\\) (e.g. \\(p_c = p_n\\) or \\(p_c - p_n = 0\\)). We also typically use it to verify the success-failure condition. When the null hypothesis is \\(p_1 = p_2\\), it is useful to find the pooled estimate of the shared proportion: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\text{number of ``successes&#39;&#39;}}{\\text{number of cases}} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1n_1 + \\hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\\end{aligned}\\] Here \\(\\hat{p}_1n_1\\) represents the number of successes in sample 1 since \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{\\text{number of successes in sample 1}}{n_1}\\end{aligned}\\] Similarly, \\(\\hat{p}_2n_2\\) represents the number of successes in sample 2. When the null hypothesis suggests the proportions are equal, we use the pooled proportion estimate (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) to verify the success-failure condition and also to estimate the standard error: \\[\\begin{aligned} SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_2}} \\label{seOfDiffInPropUsingPooledEstimate}\\end{aligned}\\] [verifySEOfPooledEstimateOf24DWithCancerNoCancerDogs] Using Equation , \\(\\hat{p}=0.345\\), \\(n_1 = 491\\), and \\(n_2=945\\), verify the estimate for the standard error is \\(SE = 0.026\\). Next, complete the hypothesis test using a significance level of 0.05. Be certain to draw a picture, compute the p-value, and state your conclusion in both statistical language and plain language.29 12.3 Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square (special topic) In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned. This technique is commonly used in two circumstances: Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population. Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution. (Background on the geometric distribution is not necessary.) Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test. In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in Table [juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace], and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters. ll ccc c ll Race &amp; &amp; White &amp; Black &amp; Hispanic &amp; Other &amp; &amp; Total Representation in juries &amp; &amp; 205 &amp; 26 &amp; 25 &amp; 19 &amp; &amp; 275 Registered voters &amp; &amp; 0.72 &amp; 0.07 &amp; 0.12 &amp; 0.09 &amp; &amp; 1.00 [juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace] While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative. A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for the years 1990-2011 are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock’s behavior on previous days. In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic. 12.3.1 Creating a test statistic for one-way tables Of the people in the city, 275 served on a jury. If the individuals are randomly selected to serve on a jury, about how many of the 275 people would we expect to be white? How many would we expect to be black? About 72% of the population is white, so we would expect about 72% of the jurors to be white: \\(0.72\\times 275 = 198\\). Similarly, we would expect about 7% of the jurors to be black, which would correspond to about \\(0.07\\times 275 = 19.25\\) black jurors. Twelve percent of the population is Hispanic and 9% represent other races. How many of the 275 jurors would we expect to be Hispanic or from another race? Answers can be found in Table [expectedJuryRepresentationIfNoBias]. ll ccc c ll Race &amp; &amp; White &amp; Black &amp; Hispanic &amp; Other &amp; &amp; Total Observed data &amp; &amp; 205 &amp; 26 &amp; 25 &amp; 19 &amp; &amp; 275 Expected counts &amp; &amp; 198 &amp; 19.25 &amp; 33 &amp; 24.75 &amp; &amp; 275 [expectedJuryRepresentationIfNoBias] The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses: The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation. The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection. To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone. 12.3.2 The chi-square test statistic In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form: \\[\\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{\\text{SE of point estimate}}\\] This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data. Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference: \\[\\begin{aligned} Z_{1} = \\frac{\\text{observed white count} - \\text{null white count}} {\\text{SE of observed white count}}\\end{aligned}\\] The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null.30 Therefore: \\[\\begin{aligned} Z_1 = \\frac{205 - 198}{\\sqrt{198}} = 0.50\\end{aligned}\\] The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the black, Hispanic, and other groups: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;Black &amp;&amp; Hispanic &amp;&amp;Other \\\\ &amp; Z_2 = \\frac{26-19.25}{\\sqrt{19.25}}=1.54\\ \\ \\ \\ &amp;&amp; Z_3 = \\frac{25-33}{\\sqrt{33}}=-1.39\\ \\ \\ \\ &amp;&amp; Z_4 = \\frac{19-24.75}{\\sqrt{24.75}}=-1.16 \\\\\\end{aligned}\\] We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, \\(Z_1\\), \\(Z_2\\), \\(Z_3\\), and \\(Z_4\\) must be combined somehow to help determine if they – as a group – tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them up: \\[\\begin{aligned} |Z_1| + |Z_2| + |Z_3| + |Z_4| = 4.58\\end{aligned}\\] Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values: \\[\\begin{aligned} Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 = 5.89\\end{aligned}\\] Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things: Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive. Differences that already look unusual – e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5 – will become much larger after being squared. The test statistic \\(X^2\\)[ \\(X^2\\) chi-square test statistic] \\(X^2\\) chi-square test statistic , which is the sum of the \\(Z^2\\) values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for \\(X^2\\) using the observed counts and null counts: The final number \\(X^2\\) summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In Section [pValueForAChiSquareTest], we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then \\(X^2\\) follows a new distribution called a chi-square distribution. Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses. 12.3.3 The chi-square distribution and finding areas The chi-square distribution is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall the normal distribution had two parameters – mean and standard deviation – that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called , which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution. [exerChiSquareDistributionDescriptionWithMoreDOF] Figure [chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF] shows three chi-square distributions. (a) How does the center of the distribution change when the degrees of freedom is larger? (b) What about the variability (spread)? (c) How does the shape change?31 Three chi-square distributions with varying degrees of freedom. [chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF] Figure [chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF] and Guided Practice [exerChiSquareDistributionDescriptionWithMoreDOF] demonstrate three general properties of chi-square distributions as the degrees of freedom increases: the distribution becomes more symmetric, the center moves to the right, and the variability inflates. Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. To do so, a new table is needed: the chi-square table, partially shown in Table [chiSquareProbabilityTableShort]. A more complete table is presented in Appendix . Using this table, we identify a range for the area, and we examine a particular row for distributions with different degrees of freedom. One important quality of this table: the chi-square table only provides upper tail values. A section of the chi-square table. A complete table is listed in Appendix . Upper tail 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.02 0.01 0.005 0.001 df 2 2.41 5.99 7.82 9.21 10.60 13.82 3 &amp; 3.66 &amp; 4.64 &amp; &amp; 7.81 &amp; 9.84 &amp; 11.34 &amp; 12.84 &amp; 16.27 4 &amp; 4.88 &amp; 5.99 &amp; 7.78 &amp; 9.49 &amp; 11.67 &amp; 13.28 &amp; 14.86 &amp; 18.47 5 &amp; 6.06 &amp; 7.29 &amp; 9.24 &amp; 11.07 &amp; 13.39 &amp; 15.09 &amp; 16.75 &amp; 20.52 6 &amp; 7.23 &amp; 8.56 &amp; 10.64 &amp; 12.59 &amp; 15.03 &amp; 16.81 &amp; 18.55 &amp; 22.46 7 &amp; 8.38 &amp; 9.80 &amp; 12.02 &amp; 14.07 &amp; 16.62 &amp; 18.48 &amp; 20.28 &amp; 24.32 ******** [chiSquareProbabilityTableShort] Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove6Point25WithDF3] shows a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom and an upper shaded tail starting at 6.25. Use Table [chiSquareProbabilityTableShort] to estimate the shaded area.[chisquaredistexample01] This distribution has three degrees of freedom, so only the row with 3 degrees of freedom (df) is relevant. This row has been italicized in the table. Next, we see that the value – 6.25 – falls in the column with upper tail area 0.1. That is, the shaded upper tail of Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove6Point25WithDF3] has area 0.1. [arrayOfFigureAreasForChiSquareDistribution] We rarely observe the exact value in the table. For instance, Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove4Point3WithDF2] shows the upper tail of a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The bound for this upper tail is at 4.3, which does not fall in Table [chiSquareProbabilityTableShort]. Find the approximate tail area.[chisquaredistexample02] The cutoff 4.3 falls between the second and third columns in the 2 degrees of freedom row. Because these columns correspond to tail areas of 0.2 and 0.1, we can be certain that the area shaded in Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove4Point3WithDF2] is between 0.1 and 0.2. Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove5Point1WithDF5] shows an upper tail for a chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom and a cutoff of 5.1. Find the tail area.[chisquaredistexample03] Looking in the row with 5 df, 5.1 falls below the smallest cutoff for this row (6.06). That means we can only say that the area is greater than 0.3. [ChiSquareDistGuidedPractice01] Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove11Point7WithDF7] shows a cutoff of 11.7 on a chi-square distribution with 7 degrees of freedom. Find the area of the upper tail.32 [ChiSquareDistGuidedPractice02] Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove10WithDF4] shows a cutoff of 10 on a chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Find the area of the upper tail.33 [ChiSquareDistGuidedPractice03] Figure [chiSquareAreaAbove9Point21WithDF3] shows a cutoff of 9.21 with a chi-square distribution with 3 df. Find the area of the upper tail.34 12.3.4 Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution In Section [chiSquareTestStatistic], we identified a new test statistic (\\(X^2\\)) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled. We determined that a large \\(X^2\\) value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic (\\(X^2=5.89\\)) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then \\(X^2\\) would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic \\(X^2\\) follows a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom, where \\(k\\) is the number of bins. How many categories were there in the juror example? How many degrees of freedom should be associated with the chi-square distribution used for \\(X^2\\)? In the jurors example, there were \\(k=4\\) categories: white, black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic \\(X^2\\) should then follow a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1 = 3\\) degrees of freedom if \\(H_0\\) is true. Just like we checked sample size conditions to use the normal model in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for \\(X^2\\). Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above 5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, \\(X^2=5.89\\). If the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic \\(X^2=5.89\\) would be closely associated with a chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom. Using this distribution and test statistic, identify the p-value. The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in Figure [jurorHTPValueShown]. Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using the chi-square table in Appendix [chiSquareProbabilityTable] or the short table on page , we can determine that the area is between 0.1 and 0.2. That is, the p-value is larger than 0.1 but smaller than 0.2. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection. The p-value for the juror hypothesis test is shaded in the chi-square distribution with \\(df=3\\). [jurorHTPValueShown] Suppose we are to evaluate whether there is convincing evidence that a set of observed counts \\(O_1\\), \\(O_2\\), …, \\(O_k\\) in \\(k\\) categories are unusually different from what might be expected under a null hypothesis. Call the expected counts that are based on the null hypothesis \\(E_1\\), \\(E_2\\), …, \\(E_k\\). If each expected count is at least 5 and the null hypothesis is true, then the test statistic below follows a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom: \\[\\begin{aligned} X^2 = \\frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{E_1} + \\frac{(O_2 - E_2)^2}{E_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\\end{aligned}\\] The p-value for this test statistic is found by looking at the upper tail of this chi-square distribution. We consider the upper tail because larger values of \\(X^2\\) would provide greater evidence against the null hypothesis. There are three conditions that must be checked before performing a chi-square test: Independence. Each case that contributes a count to the table must be independent of all the other cases in the table. Sample size / distribution. Each particular scenario (i.e. cell count) must have at least 5 expected cases. Degrees of freedom We only apply the chi-square technique when the table is associated with a chi-square distribution with 2 or more degrees of freedom. Failing to check conditions may affect the test’s error rates. When examining a table with just two bins, pick a single bin and use the one-proportion methods introduced in Section [singleProportion]. 12.3.5 Evaluating goodness of fit for a distribution We can apply our new chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 1990-2011 can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock’s behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as or () depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each day: lc ccc ccc ccc cc Change in price &amp; &amp; 2.52 &amp; -1.46 &amp; 0.51 &amp; -4.07 &amp; 3.36 &amp; 1.10 &amp; -5.46 &amp; -1.03 &amp; -2.99 &amp; 1.71 Outcome &amp; &amp; Up &amp; D &amp; Up &amp; D &amp; Up &amp; Up &amp; D &amp; D &amp; D &amp; Up Days to Up &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; 2 &amp; - &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; - &amp; - &amp; 4 If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the \\(k^{th}\\) trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next trading day, and two more for the third day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade] shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 1990-2011 for the S&amp;P500. ll ccc ccc c ll Days &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7+ &amp; &amp; Total Observed &amp; &amp; 1532 &amp; 760 &amp; 338 &amp; 194 &amp; 74 &amp; 33 &amp; 17 &amp; &amp; 2948 [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade] We consider how many days one must wait until observing an day on the S&amp;P500 stock exchange. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a geometric distribution. We can organize this into a hypothesis framework: The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an day should follow a geometric distribution. The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis. There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders. We consider data for the S&amp;P500 from 1990 to 2011 and summarize the waiting times in Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2] and Figure [geomFitEvaluationForSP500For1990To2011]. The S&amp;P500 was positive on 53.2% of those days. ll ccc ccc c ll Days &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7+ &amp; &amp; Total Observed &amp; &amp; 1532 &amp; 760 &amp; 338 &amp; 194 &amp; 74 &amp; 33 &amp; 17 &amp; &amp; 2948 Geometric Model &amp; &amp; 1569 &amp; 734 &amp; 343 &amp; 161 &amp; 75 &amp; 35 &amp; 31 &amp; &amp; 2948 [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2] Side-by-side bar plot of the observed and expected counts for each waiting time. [geomFitEvaluationForSP500For1990To2011] Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least 5, we have binned together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 7 days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the Observed row in Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2], can be compared to the expected counts from the Geometric Model row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2]. In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin. Do you notice any unusually large deviations in the graph? Can you tell if these deviations are due to chance just by looking? It is not obvious whether differences in the observed counts and the expected counts from the geometric distribution are significantly different. That is, it is not clear whether these deviations might be due to chance or whether they are so strong that the data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis. However, we can perform a chi-square test using the counts in Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2]. Table [sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2] provides a set of count data for waiting times (\\(O_1=1532\\), \\(O_2=760\\), …) and expected counts under the geometric distribution (\\(E_1=1569\\), \\(E_2=734\\), …). Compute the chi-square test statistic, \\(X^2\\).35 Because the expected counts are all at least 5, we can safely apply the chi-square distribution to \\(X^2\\). However, how many degrees of freedom should we use?36 If the observed counts follow the geometric model, then the chi-square test statistic \\(X^2=15.08\\) would closely follow a chi-square distribution with \\(df=6\\). Using this information, compute a p-value. [RejectGeomModelForSP500StockDataFor1990To2011] Figure [geomFitPValueForSP500For1990To2011] shows the chi-square distribution, cutoff, and the shaded p-value. If we look up the statistic \\(X^2=15.08\\) in Appendix [chiSquareProbabilityTable], we find that the p-value is between 0.01 and 0.02. In other words, we have sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the wait times follow a geometric distribution, i.e. trading days are not independent and past days may help predict what the stock market will do today. Chi-square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom. The p-value for the stock analysis is shaded. [geomFitPValueForSP500For1990To2011] In Example [RejectGeomModelForSP500StockDataFor1990To2011], we rejected the null hypothesis that the trading days are independent. Why is this so important? Because the data provided strong evidence that the geometric distribution is not appropriate, we reject the claim that trading days are independent. While it is not obvious how to exploit this information, it suggests there are some hidden patterns in the data that could be interesting and possibly useful to a stock trader. 12.4 Testing for independence in two-way tables (special topic) Google is constantly running experiments to test new search algorithms. For example, Google might test three algorithms using a sample of 10,000 google.com search queries. Table [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmOnly] shows an example of 10,000 queries split into three algorithm groups.37 The group sizes were specified before the start of the experiment to be 5000 for the current algorithm and 2500 for each test algorithm. ll ccc ll Search algorithm &amp; &amp; current &amp; test 1 &amp; test 2 &amp; &amp; Total Counts &amp; &amp; 5000 &amp; 2500 &amp; 2500 &amp; &amp; 10000 [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmOnly] What is the ultimate goal of the Google experiment? What are the null and alternative hypotheses, in regular words? The ultimate goal is to see whether there is a difference in the performance of the algorithms. The hypotheses can be described as the following: The algorithms each perform equally well. The algorithms do not perform equally well. In this experiment, the explanatory variable is the search algorithm. However, an outcome variable is also needed. This outcome variable should somehow reflect whether the search results align with the user’s interests. One possible way to quantify this is to determine whether (1) the user clicked one of the links provided and did not try a new search, or (2) the user performed a related search. Under scenario (1), we might think that the user was satisfied with the search results. Under scenario (2), the search results probably were not relevant, so the user tried a second search. Table [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals] provides the results from the experiment. These data are very similar to the count data in Section [oneWayChiSquare]. However, now the different combinations of two variables are binned in a two-way table. In examining these data, we want to evaluate whether there is strong evidence that at least one algorithm is performing better than the others. To do so, we apply a chi-square test to this two-way table. The ideas of this test are similar to those ideas in the one-way table case. However, degrees of freedom and expected counts are computed a little differently than before. ll ccc ll Search algorithm &amp; &amp; current &amp; test 1 &amp; test 2 &amp; &amp; Total No new search &amp; &amp; 3511 &amp; 1749 &amp; 1818 &amp; &amp; 7078 New search &amp; &amp; 1489 &amp; 751 &amp; 682 &amp; &amp; 2922 Total &amp; &amp; 5000 &amp; 2500 &amp; 2500 &amp; &amp; 10000 [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals] A one-way table describes counts for each outcome in a single variable. A two-way table describes counts for combinations of outcomes for two variables. When we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know, are these variables related in any way? That is, are they dependent (versus independent)? The hypothesis test for this Google experiment is really about assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence that the choice of the algorithm affects whether a user performs a second search. In other words, the goal is to check whether the search variable is independent of the algorithm variable. 12.4.1 Expected counts in two-way tables From the experiment, we estimate the proportion of users who were satisfied with their initial search (no new search) as \\(7078/10000 = 0.7078\\). If there really is no difference among the algorithms and 70.78% of people are satisfied with the search results, how many of the 5000 people in the “current algorithm” group would be expected to not perform a new search? [googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch] About 70.78% of the 5000 would be satisfied with the initial search: \\[0.7078\\times 5000 = 3539\\text{ users}\\] That is, if there was no difference between the three groups, then we would expect 3539 of the current algorithm users not to perform a new search. [googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfNewAlgGroupWithNoNewSearch] Using the same rationale described in Example [googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch], about how many users in each test group would not perform a new search if the algorithms were equally helpful?38 We can compute the expected number of users who would perform a new search for each group using the same strategy employed in Example [googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch] and Guided Practice [googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfNewAlgGroupWithNoNewSearch]. These expected counts were used to construct Table [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithExpectedCounts], which is the same as Table [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals], except now the expected counts have been added in parentheses. l lll lll lll l Search algorithm &amp; &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; &amp; &amp; Total No new search &amp; 3511 &amp; &amp;&amp; 1749 &amp; &amp;&amp; 1818 &amp; &amp; &amp; 7078 New search &amp; 1489 &amp; &amp;&amp; 751 &amp; &amp;&amp; 682 &amp; &amp; &amp; 2922 Total &amp; 5000 &amp;&amp;&amp; 2500 &amp;&amp;&amp; 2500 &amp;&amp;&amp; 10000 [googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithExpectedCounts] The examples and guided practice above provided some help in computing expected counts. In general, expected counts for a two-way table may be computed using the row totals, column totals, and the table total. For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 70.78% of each column should be in the first row: \\[\\begin{aligned} 0.7078\\times (\\text{column 1 total}) &amp;= 3539 \\\\ 0.7078\\times (\\text{column 2 total}) &amp;= 1769.5 \\\\ 0.7078\\times (\\text{column 3 total}) &amp;= 1769.5\\end{aligned}\\] Looking back to how the fraction 0.7078 was computed – as the fraction of users who did not perform a new search (\\(7078/10000\\)) – these three expected counts could have been computed as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\\text{(column 1 total)} &amp;= 3539 \\\\ \\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\\text{(column 2 total)} &amp;= 1769.5 \\\\ \\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\\text{(column 3 total)} &amp;= 1769.5\\end{aligned}\\] This leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable. To identify the expected count for the \\(i^{th}\\) row and \\(j^{th}\\) column, compute $$i,j = $$ 12.4.2 The chi-square test for two-way tables The chi-square test statistic for a two-way table is found the same way it is found for a one-way table. For each table count, compute \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\text{General formula}&amp; &amp;\\frac{(\\text{observed count } - \\text{ expected count})^2}{\\text{expected count}} \\\\ &amp;\\text{Row 1, Col 1}&amp; &amp;\\frac{(3511 - 3539)^2}{3539} = 0.222 \\\\ &amp;\\text{Row 1, Col 2}&amp; &amp;\\frac{(1749 - 1769.5)^2}{1769.5} = 0.237 \\\\ &amp; \\hspace{9mm}\\vdots &amp; &amp;\\hspace{13mm}\\vdots \\\\ &amp;\\text{Row 2, Col 3}&amp; &amp;\\frac{(682 - 730.5)^2}{730.5} = 3.220\\end{aligned}\\] Adding the computed value for each cell gives the chi-square test statistic \\(X^2\\): \\[X^2 = 0.222 + 0.237 + \\dots + 3.220 = 6.120\\] Just like before, this test statistic follows a chi-square distribution. However, the degrees of freedom are computed a little differently for a two-way table.39 For two way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to \\[\\begin{aligned} df = \\text{(number of rows minus 1)}\\times \\text{(number of columns minus 1)}\\end{aligned}\\] In our example, the degrees of freedom parameter is \\[\\begin{aligned} df = (2-1)\\times (3-1) = 2\\end{aligned}\\] If the null hypothesis is true (i.e. the algorithms are equally useful), then the test statistic \\(X^2 = 6.12\\) closely follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using this information, we can compute the p-value for the test, which is depicted in Figure [googleHTForDiffAlgPerformancePValue]. When applying the chi-square test to a two-way table, we use \\[df = (R-1)\\times (C-1)\\] where \\(R\\) is the number of rows in the table and \\(C\\) is the number of columns. When analyzing 2-by-2 contingency tables, use the two-proportion methods introduced in Section [differenceOfTwoProportions]. Computing the p-value for the Google hypothesis test. [googleHTForDiffAlgPerformancePValue] Compute the p-value and draw a conclusion about whether the search algorithms have different performances. Looking in Appendix [chiSquareProbabilityTable] on page , we examine the row corresponding to 2 degrees of freedom. The test statistic, \\(X^2=6.120\\), falls between the fourth and fifth columns, which means the p-value is between 0.02 and 0.05. Because we typically test at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) and the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that there is some difference in performance among the algorithms. Table [pewResearchPollOnApprovalRatingsForChiSquareSectionExampleAndExercises] summarizes the results of a Pew Research poll.40 We would like to determine if there are actually differences in the approval ratings of Barack Obama, Democrats in Congress, and Republicans in Congress. What are appropriate hypotheses for such a test?[hypothesisTestSetupForPewResearchPollOnApprovalRatingsForChiSquareSection] There is no difference in approval ratings between the three groups.

This question was especially tricky because one group was called the control group, which is a term usually seen in experiments.↩ Using the proportions within the cancer and no cancer groups may seem odd. We intuitively may desire to compare the fraction of dogs with cancer in the 2,4-D and no 2,4-D groups, since the herbicide is an explanatory variable. However, the cancer rates in each group do not necessarily reflect the cancer rates in reality due to the way the data were collected. For this reason, computing cancer rates may greatly alarm dog owners. \\(H_0\\): the proportion of dogs with exposure to 2,4-D is the same in “cancer” and “no cancer” dogs, \\(p_c - p_n = 0\\). \\(H_A\\): dogs with cancer are more likely to have been exposed to 2,4-D than dogs without cancer, \\(p_c - p_n &gt; 0\\).↩ Compute the test statistic: \\[\\begin{aligned} Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{0.067 - 0}{0.026} = 2.58\\end{aligned}\\] We leave the picture to you. Looking up \\(Z=2.58\\) in the normal probability table: 0.9951. However this is the lower tail, and the upper tail represents the p-value: \\(1-0.9951 = 0.0049\\).

The X and Y values were both sampled from the same normal distribution (mean = 0, sd=1). 1000 simulations were conducted for each sample size (10,50,100,1000). For each, the animiation shows 10 scatterplots where the observed “correlation” would have passed a significance test. According to definition, these correlations only arise from random normal deviates 5% of the time, but when they do arise for small sample sizes, they look fairly convincing. all_df&lt;-data.frame() for(n in c(10,50,100,1000)){ count_sims&lt;-0 for(sim in 1:1000){ North_pole &lt;- rnorm(n,0,1) South_pole &lt;- rnorm(n,0,1) if(cor.test(North_pole,South_pole)$p.value&lt;.05){ count_sims&lt;-count_sims+1 t_df&lt;-data.frame(nsize=rep(n,n), simulation=rep(count_sims,n), North_pole, South_pole) all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df) if(count_sims==10){ break } } } } ggplot(all_df,aes(x=North_pole,y=South_pole))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)+ theme_classic()+ facet_wrap(~nsize)+ transition_states( simulation, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1 )+enter_fade() + exit_shrink() + ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) 13.1.5 Cell-size and correlation This simulation illustrates how the behavior of correlating two random normal samples as a function of cell-size. The sample-size is always set at N=10. For each panel, the simulation uses an increasing cell-size to estimate the mean for X and Y. When cell-size is 1, 10 X and Y values are drawn from the same normal (u=0, sd=1). When cell-size is 5, for each X,Y score in the plot, 5 samples were drawn from the same normal, and then the mean of the samples is plotted. The effect of cell-size shrinks the dot cloud, as both X and Y scores provide better estimates of the population mean = 0. Cell-size has no effect on the behavior of r, which swings around because sample-size N is small. These are all random, so there is always a 5% type I error rate (alpha =.05). get_sampling_means&lt;-function(m,sd,cell_size,s_size){ save_means&lt;-length(s_size) for(i in 1:s_size){ save_means[i]&lt;-mean(rnorm(cell_size,m,sd)) } return(save_means) } all_df&lt;-data.frame() for(n in c(1,5,10,100)){ count_sims&lt;-0 for(sim in 1:10){ North_pole &lt;- get_sampling_means(0,1,n,10) South_pole &lt;- get_sampling_means(0,1,n,10) count_sims&lt;-count_sims+1 t_df&lt;-data.frame(nsize=rep(n,10), simulation=rep(count_sims,10), North_pole, South_pole) all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df) } } ggplot(all_df,aes(x=North_pole,y=South_pole))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)+ theme_classic()+ facet_wrap(~nsize)+ ggtitle(&quot;Random scatterplots, N=10, Cell-size = 1,5,10,100&quot;)+ transition_states( simulation, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1 )+enter_fade() + exit_shrink() + ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) 13.1.6 Regression We look at how the residuals (error from points to line) behave as the regression lines moves above and below it’s true value. The total error associated with all of the red lines is represents by the grey area. This total error is smallest (minimized) when the black line overlaps with the blue regression line (the best fit line). The total error expands as the black line moves away from the regression. That’s why the regression line is the least wrong (best fit) line to skewer the data (according to least squares definition) d &lt;- mtcars fit &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = d) d$predicted &lt;- predict(fit) # Save the predicted values d$residuals &lt;- residuals(fit) # Save the residual values coefs&lt;-coef(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)) coefs[1] coefs[2] x&lt;-d$hp move_line&lt;-c(seq(-6,6,.5),seq(6,-6,-.5)) total_error&lt;-length(length(move_line)) cnt&lt;-0 for(i in move_line){ cnt&lt;-cnt+1 predicted_y &lt;- coefs[2]*x + coefs[1]+i error_y &lt;- (predicted_y-d$mpg)^2 total_error[cnt]&lt;-sqrt(sum(error_y)/32) } move_line_sims&lt;-rep(move_line,each=32) total_error_sims&lt;-rep(total_error,each=32) sims&lt;-rep(1:50,each=32) d&lt;-d %&gt;% slice(rep(row_number(), 50)) d&lt;-cbind(d,sims,move_line_sims,total_error_sims) anim&lt;-ggplot(d, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, frame=sims)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 30.09886+move_line_sims, slope = -0.06822828)+ lims(x = c(0,400), y = c(-10,40))+ geom_segment(aes(xend = hp, yend = predicted+move_line_sims, color=&quot;red&quot;), alpha = .5) + geom_point() + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = predicted+move_line_sims - total_error_sims, ymax = predicted+move_line_sims + total_error_sims), fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;, alpha=.2)+ theme_classic()+ theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;X&quot;)+ylab(&quot;Y&quot;)+ transition_manual(frames=sims)+ enter_fade() + exit_fade()+ ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) animate(anim,fps=5) 13.2 Sampling distributions 13.2.1 Sampling from a uniform distribution Animation shows histograms for N=20, sampled from a uniform distribution, along with mean (red line).

Individual sample histograms in grey. Vertical red line is mean of individual sample. Histograms for sampling distribution of the sample mean in blue. Vertical blue line is mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Note: for purposes of the animation (and because it was easier to do this way), the histograms for the sampling distribution of the sample means have different sizes. When sample-size = 10, the histogram shows 10 sample means. When sample size=100, the histogram shows 100 sample means. I could have simulated many more sample means (say 10000) for each, but then the histograms for the sample means would be static. The y-axis is very rough. The heights of the histrograms and distributions were scaled to be in the same range for the animation. get_sampling_means&lt;-function(m,sd,s_size){ save_means&lt;-length(s_size) for(i in 1:s_size){ save_means[i]&lt;-mean(rnorm(s_size,m,sd)) } return(save_means) } all_df&lt;-data.frame() for(sims in 1:10){ for(n in c(10,50,100,1000)){ sample&lt;-rnorm(n,0,1) sample_means&lt;-get_sampling_means(0,1,n) t_df&lt;-data.frame(sims=rep(sims,n), sample, sample_means, sample_size=rep(n,n), sample_mean=rep(mean(sample),n), sampling_mean=rep(mean(sample_means),n) ) all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df) } } ggplot(all_df, aes(x=sample))+ geom_histogram(aes(y=(..density..)/max(..density..)^.8),color=&quot;white&quot;,fill=&quot;grey&quot;)+ geom_histogram(aes(x=sample_means,y=(..density..)/max(..density..)),fill=&quot;blue&quot;,color=&quot;white&quot;,alpha=.5)+ stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), lwd = .75, col = &#39;red&#39;)+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=sample_mean,frame=sims),color=&quot;red&quot;)+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=sampling_mean,frame=sims),color=&quot;blue&quot;)+ facet_wrap(~sample_size)+xlim(-3,3)+ theme_classic()+ggtitle(&quot;Population (red), Samples (grey), \\n and Sampling distribution of the mean (blue)&quot;)+ylab(&quot;Rough likelihoods&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;value&quot;)+ transition_states( sims, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1 )+enter_fade() + exit_shrink() + ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) 13.2.3 Null and True effect samples and sampling means The null dots show 50 different samples, with the red dot as the mean for each sample. Null dots are all sampled from normal (u=0, sd=1). The true dots show 50 more samples, with red dots for their means. However, the mean of the true shifts between -1.5 and +1.5 standard deviations of 0. This illustrates how a true effect moves in and out of the null range. all_df&lt;-data.frame() all_df_means&lt;-data.frame() dif_sim&lt;-seq(-1.5,1.5,.25) for(sim in 1:13){ values&lt;-c(rnorm(25*25,0,1),rnorm(25*25,dif_sim[sim],1)) samples&lt;-c(rep(seq(1:25),each=25),rep(seq(1:25),each=25)) df&lt;-data.frame(samples,values,sims=rep(sim,50*25),type=rep(c(&quot;null&quot;,&quot;true&quot;),each=625)) df_means&lt;-aggregate(values~samples*type,df,mean, sims=rep(sim,50)) all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,df) all_df_means&lt;-rbind(all_df_means,df_means) } all_df&lt;-cbind(all_df,means=rep(all_df_means$values,each=25)) ggplot(all_df,aes(y=values,x=samples))+ geom_point(aes(color=abs(values)), alpha=.25)+ geom_point(aes(y=means,x=samples),color=&quot;red&quot;)+ theme_classic()+ geom_vline(xintercept=25.5)+ facet_wrap(~type)+ geom_hline(yintercept=0)+ theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;null=0, True effect moves from -1.5 sd to 1.5 sd&quot;)+ transition_states( sims, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1 )+enter_fade() + exit_shrink() + ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) 13.3 Statistical Inference 13.3.1 Randomization Test This is an attempt at visualizing a randomization test. Samples are taken under two conditions of the IV (A and B). At the beginning of the animation, the original scores in the first condition are shown as green dots on the left, and the original scores in the second condition are the red dots on the right. The means for each group are the purple dots. During the randomization, the original scores are shuffled randomly between the two conditions. After each shuffle, two new means are computed and displayed as the yellow dots. This occurs either for all permutations, or for a large random sample of them. The animation shows the original scores being shuffled around across the randomizations (the colored dots switch their original condition, appearing from side to side). For intuitive inference, one might look at the range of motion of the yellow dots. This is how the mean difference between group 1 and group 2 behaves under randomization. It’s what chance can do. If the difference between the purple dots is well outside the range of motion of the yellow dots, then the mean difference observed in the beginning is not likely produced by chance. study&lt;-round(runif(10,80,100)) no_study&lt;-round(runif(10,40,90)) study_df&lt;-data.frame(student=seq(1:10),study,no_study) mean_original&lt;-data.frame(IV=c(&quot;studied&quot;,&quot;didnt_study&quot;), means=c(mean(study),mean(no_study))) t_df&lt;-data.frame(sims=rep(1,20), IV=rep(c(&quot;studied&quot;,&quot;didnt_study&quot;),each=10), values=c(study,no_study), rand_order=rep(c(0,1),each=10)) raw_df&lt;-t_df for(i in 2:10){ new_index&lt;-sample(1:20) t_df$values&lt;-t_df$values[new_index] t_df$rand_order&lt;-t_df$rand_order[new_index] t_df$sims&lt;-rep(i,20) raw_df&lt;-rbind(raw_df,t_df) } raw_df$rand_order&lt;-as.factor(raw_df$rand_order) rand_df&lt;-aggregate(values~sims*IV,raw_df,mean) names(rand_df)&lt;-c(&quot;sims&quot;,&quot;IV&quot;,&quot;means&quot;) a&lt;-ggplot(raw_df,aes(x=IV,y=values,color=rand_order,size=3))+ geom_point(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,alpha=.5)+ geom_point(data=mean_original,aes(x=IV,y=means),stat=&quot;identity&quot;,shape=21,size=6,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;mediumorchid2&quot;)+ geom_point(data=rand_df,aes(x=IV,y=means),stat=&quot;identity&quot;,shape=21,size=6,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;gold&quot;)+ theme_classic(base_size = 15)+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(40, 100))+ theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Randomization test: Original Means (purple), \\n Randomized means (yellow) \\n Original scores (red,greenish)&quot;)+ transition_states( sims, transition_length = 1, state_length = 2 )+enter_fade() + exit_shrink() + ease_aes(&#39;sine-in-out&#39;) animate(a,nframes=100,fps=5) "]
