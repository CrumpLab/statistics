On the next page test takers were prompted for three more variables:

age. entered as as text then parsed to an interger.
gender. chosen from drop down list (1=male, 2=female, 3=other)
accuracy. How accurate they thought their answers were on a scale from 0 to 100, answers were entered as text and parsed to an integer. They were instructed to enter a 0 if they did not want to be included in research.	

The four scale scores of the HSQ were calculated as such (php code):

affiliative. round(((6-$_POST['Q1']) + $_POST['Q5'] + (6-$_POST['Q9']) + $_POST['Q13'] + (6-$_POST['Q17']) + $_POST['Q21'] + (6-$_POST['Q25']) + (6-$_POST['Q29']))/8, 1);
selfenhancing. round(($_POST['Q2'] + $_POST['Q6'] + $_POST['Q10'] + $_POST['Q14'] + $_POST['Q18'] + $_POST['Q22'] + $_POST['Q26'] + $_POST['Q30'])/8,1);
aggressive. round(($_POST['Q3']+ $_POST['Q7'] + $_POST['Q11'] + $_POST['Q15'] + $_POST['Q19'] + $_POST['Q23'] + $_POST['Q27'] + $_POST['Q31'])/8,1);
selfdefeating. round(($_POST['Q4'] + $_POST['Q8'] + $_POST['Q12'] + $_POST['Q16'] + $_POST['Q20'] + $_POST['Q24'] + $_POST['Q28'] + $_POST['Q32'])/8,1);
