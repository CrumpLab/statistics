## Important notes

This is a working revision of the OER statistics
textbook titled: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and
Simulation, by Diaz, Barr, & Cetinkaya-Rundel.

The original source latex files were obtained from :
https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs

The original textbook is licensed under a Creative Commons license.

The original latex were converted to Markdown using pandoc. Some
minimal typesetting was completed on the first chapter.

The plan is to use this textbook as a starting point for developing another OER textbook for tailored for undergraduate psychology students.

The Github changelog from this point forward reflects all of our
changes to the original textbook. The github repository for this project is [https://github.com/CrumpLab/statistics](https://github.com/CrumpLab/statistics)
