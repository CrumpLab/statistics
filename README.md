## What is this?

This is an in draft FREE Statistics for Undergrads in Psychology Textbook, on a creative commons license. Yes, there are so many existing OERs (open-educational resources) for statistics, but there is always room for one more.

## We are remixing, editing, revising, these amazing two resources:

1. Danielle Navarro's "Learning Statistics with R" [https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/)

2. Diaz, Barr, & Cetinkaya-Rundel's "Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation"  [https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs)

Thank you to the original author's for their fantastic work.

## What are our plans for Summer 2018 

1. We are writing the book in Rmarkdown, using the bookdown package. Rmarkdown is super convenient for this purpose. All of the source code for compiling the book will be here.

2. We will integrate R shiny apps into the web-book, so that student's can play around with statistical ideas as they read about them. Very excited about this.

3. We are developing a companion lab manual with weekly exercises, covering how to do things using R, Excel, JASP (or matlab possibly), and SPSS.

4. We will be implementing this new curriculum in Fall 2018 at Brooklyn College of CUNY.
